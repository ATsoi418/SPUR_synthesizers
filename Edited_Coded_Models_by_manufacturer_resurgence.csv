the popular M1. The 01/W was the second chapter in Korg's workstation
legacy, which goes on to this day with the Triton and Oasys series. The 01/W was
geared towards beginning home studio enthusiasts that wanted to
take a step further into a more professional realm. Compared with the M1, the 01/W featured 
many enhancements including a more dynamic 16-track sequencer (the M1
only had 8-tracks), 254 real world sampled instruments to the M1's 100, 
polyphony was doubled from 16 to 32 voices, and greater overall control.The 01/W synthesis engine is based on Korg's own  AI2 sample
+ synthesis design. AI2 was so successful that most later
Korg synths in the 90's were also based on the new synthesis method. The
01/W is by no means difficult to program. There is a Quick Edit feature
where you can adjust the parameters to the sounds you want by using
eight soft buttons. That included octave, wave-shaping intensity, filter
EG, VDA level, attack, release and effects level. Like the M1, the 01/W lets you layer up to eight Programs
simultaneously to create a powerful Combination. Even without getting
into the editing interface, the ability to layer any of the 200 programs
together means you can create many diverse and interesting sounds. Another big feature of the 01/W is its internal sequencer. Combining ease of use
with powerful editing features such as copy, paste, move, overdub and
punch-in & out recording, it is possible to create complex and highly
professional sounding music all in one box without the need for a
computer-based solution. The sequencer also works well in a
master keyboard situation so that you can select channels to control
external tone generators as well as the 01/W's internal sounds. As powerful and versatile as this workstation is, however, there are
downsides. Although there are 47 different fully assignable effects to
choose from, only two are useable at any time, and act globally over all
tracks in the sequencer! There is also no resonance control, so there
are a very limited number of fun, synthy patches, with the 01/W leaning
more toward the traditional acoustic instruments and sampled waveforms style (it's
a true digital keyboard; the polar opposite of analog ideology). In
addition, a few of the drum sets were mapped differently from the others,
and were thus not interchangeable within the sequencer.The original 01/W actually didn't sell very well, mostly because of its
limited sequencer memory capacity. But the 01/WFD expanded
the memory and added a Floppy Drive for disk storage and then it sold like hot-cakes
and was followed up with rack-mount, 76 and 88 keyboard models.
The 01/W-series was later replaced by the Trinity and Triton
workstations. Nevertheless, the Korg 01/W-series was one of the most
powerful workstations of its time, and it still holds itself together
in a mix. Admittedly, the effects section does help, but the basic
samples are quite good, especially the organ, pad and string
sounds. Guitar and piano sounds are not its strong points, but the
former benefits a lot from the great distortion effect. And the later models
also featured an upgraded and much better sounding acoustic piano sound. All in all, an
ideal board for pop, r&b, (hard) rock...less suitable for dance
music. The 01/W-series has been used by Rick Wakeman, Tony Banks,
Keith Emerson, Phil Collins, Jan Hammer, Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, Greg Phillanganes, Rod Argent,
Dave Stewart, Patrick Moraz, Moby, Eddie Jobson, Chuck Leavell, T
Lavitz, Tom Coster, and Peter Gabriel.Korg 01/W01/W - Original 61-key model. Was not a big seller, its sequencer memory was miniscule and had no external storage.Korg 01/WFD01/WFD - Same as original but with added internal floppy disk drive capable of loading and storing sequencer data and program patches and the sequencer memory was expanded from 7,000 notes to 48,000. The 01/WFD was a huge success for Korg.Korg 01/Wpro01/Wpro - Same as 01/WFD but featuring a 76-note keyboard and an added Acoustic Piano Sample.Korg 01/WproX01/WproX - An 88-weighted key version of the 01/Wpro. Also with a huge wood surface, it's really nice although a bit big!Korg 01R/W01R/W - A rack-mount module version of the 01/W.Korg 03R/W03R/W - A very stripped-down 01R/W, smaller, less sounds, less polyphony, budget oriented.Korg 05R/W05R/W - A rack-mount module based on the Korg X3, not a true 01/W descendent.Trivia note: Apparently when the engineers at Korg were presenting their
new workstation to replace the Korg M1, they were going to call it the
Korg M10, but apparently someone in marketing saw the name upside down,
and M10 now read ""01W"". Apparently they liked that a lot better and made
it the official name of the synth.",

is worth it for the retro synth strings and fat bass synth tones.The synth is split into two sections, Strings and Synth, for which there
are separate audio outputs along with a combined output for headphones

two pitch sliders (16' and 8') along with two tone controls (Bass and
Treble) and variable Attack and Release controls to modify the sound.

the 49-note keyboard for pitch bending and modulation capabilities. The
construction is solid and heavy partly due to the implementation of a

series instrument with two synth-parts and
eight drum-parts. Sort of combining the elements of the original
ElecTribe EA-1 and ER-1, 
the new EM-1 is an all-in-one groove and dance music machine for DJs and musicians alike!The EM-1 has loads of drum sounds, all of which are excellent for dance music.
There are 144 different sounds, and patterns can have up to eight drum parts. Parts
can be muted and individually processed, live and in realtime. The synth sounds
consist of 50 waveforms and a pattern can hold up to two synth parts. 
Waveform editing includes volume, panning, envelope, filtering, roll-effect, 
internal effects processing, pitch, and glide (portamento). The filter is only
a 12 dB/oct low-pass with cutoff and resonance controls which is a little thin, but
it still gets the point across.Naturally, the EM-1 features an advanced built-in sequencer with multi-effects
for complete Music Production features. The sequencer holds up to 256 patterns
and 16 songs. It ships with 192 of them full of cool dance programs to get you going.
Sequencing is done in step or real time using the 16 pads which represent 16th notes
of a 1-bar pattern. Patterns can be up to 64-steps (4-bars) long. Built-in effects
consist of two processors, a Master (global) Delay and one of 11 Insert Effects. The insert effects
include Reverb, Flanger/Chorus, Phaser, Ring modulator, Pitch shifter, Compressor, 
Distortion, Decimator, Resonator, and Modulation Delay. The Motion Sequencer functions
can record movements of the EM-1's knobs in realtime and store them with your Patterns
to add rhythmic effects, filter sweeps, and evolving synth or effect changes.The EM-1 is certainly a cool dance music production system! On the Professional level,
its two-voices of synth parts is very slim pickings. On the other hand, it can offer
Pro-DJ's incredible performance potential! For example, you can store up to 64
patterns to the step keys for realtime pattern recall. Combine that with realtime 
part muting/soloing, and realtime filtering, tweaking and effecting, tap-tempo or MIDI
clock sync for an excellent groove machine! Although there are far fewer hands-on knobs than 
on the Yamaha AN-200 and DX-200, 
the EM-1 is less expensive and offers a great nag for its buck! It has been used by The Prodigy.",126

original ElecTribe series of dance music sequencer/synthesizers from
Korg. The EMX-1 comes in a sturdy metal chassis with larger back-lit LCD
display, expanded memory, voices & multitimbrality, more real-time
controllers and vacuum tubes! Effects, Motion Sequencing, and Pattern
length have also been expanded. And a new ribbon controller and slider
have been added, providing a remarkable realtime interface for accessing
the powerful arpeggiator.Starting with its synth engine, the EMX-1 uses MMT synthesis (Multi
Modeling Technology) which offers sixteen different oscillator
algorithms, providing powerful analog synthesis models as well as
sophisticated additive, PCM, chord, unison, combination, wave shaping,
formant models and more. The built-in PCM library includes 207 drum PCM
sounds and 76 synth PCM sounds ready for immediate use, ranging from
powerful kicks and snares through amazingly unique organic sounds.
External audio signals can be manipulated using the Comb Filter
oscillator algorithm, and then further processed by the internal filter
and effects. The EMX-1 allows you to create up to nine drum parts, five
synth parts, plus accent parts that let you add dynamic accents to the
drum and synth parts (for a total of 16 parts). Each part features
extensive LFO and EG modulation. Each algorithm of the synthesis engine
has two realtime adjustable parameters, plus some other menu-based
parameters like waveform type, or chord quality. The brand-new filter lets
you chose Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass or Band Pass Plus.The two Vacuum tubes (Valve Force Circuitry) create an analog tube
circuit to add warmth and presence to your sounds. The tube gain knob
adjusts the level of the output signal passing through the vacuum tubes,
creating dynamic sounds with the distinctive tonal quality that only
tubes deliver. Three stereo effect processors are available for
simultaneous use. Each part can be independently routed to any of the
three effects processors, and you can even use the Chain function to
link multiple effects in series. Each processor offers 16 effect types
including reverb, delay, flanger and chorus, tempo-based delay, talking
modulator, grain shifter, decimator and more. The edits you make to each
of the effects processors can be saved with each pattern.As for the sequencing capabilities, up to 256 patterns can be created
and stored to the internal memory. The EMX-1 ships with  196 assorted
patterns covering house, hip-hop, R&B, electronica, drum n bass, techno,
trance and more. You can combine patterns, add mute data and knob
movements to create up to 64 songs, the EMX-1 ships with 3 demo songs.
Favorite patterns can be assigned to Pattern Sets for instant access.
Data can be quickly saved and loaded via SmartMedia cards. Realtime
recording lets you record phrases as you perform, and step recording
allows you to input the timing, pitch and duration one note at a time.
Motion Sequencing records your realtime knob tweaks and plays them back
as part of the pattern. Two types of motion sequence are provided; one
for effects and one for parts, and you can also edit the value of
individual steps. Up to 24 motion sequences can be used in a single
pattern, allowing you to control virtually every sound parameter. 
And, using Auto BPM detection, the EMX-1 can follow the tempo of an
external audio source. You can also use Tap Tempo to input the beat, set
the tempo internally, or sync up to an external MIDI clock.The EMX-1 is a fantastic dance production machine best suited for live
performances. The sounds of the synth and drum parts are excellent, and
totally contemporary with your favorite electronica artists (because
they use it too). Easy and intuitive to use, flexible, fun and
inspiring. Click on the YouTube link above to see and hear it in action!",126

effects knobs to drastically alter the sample.""  Connect it to the ElecTribe-A and 
ElecTribe-R for a complete studio for under $1,500! The sampler is excellent and is complemented by synth-like
controls for filtering, pitch and effects and a great loop-based sequencer.
It can get up to 95 seconds of sampling time, and the sounds are ""as fat and gritty as ever"".
There are 11 effects plus delay that you can apply while sampling, a
feature that works great with Resampling to add and layer different effects to each of your samples.
You can also use the knobs to modify the tone while resampling a sound.A new Time Slice Function will cut up samples to make them fit the tempo.
Time Slice detects the attacks of each part within a loop (e.g., bass drum, snare, and hi-hat)
for simple and accurate loop manipulation.
And the ""Motion Sequence"" function from previous ElecTribes is also on-board
to record real-time changes to effects, filter, and Time Slice Elements.The ElecTribe S provides a Smart Media slot for storing data. 3.3 V Smart Media
ranging from 4 MB to 64 MB can be used to store your own sampled sounds, patterns

Nine parts are set up to play as ""one-shot"" samples, or Drum Parts. Two
additional Keyboard Parts allow samples to be played melodically at
various pitches right from the step keys or a MIDI input device. Sampled loops
can be assigned to the Stretch Parts. As Stretch Parts, their tempos can
be freely adjusted without affecting their pitch. This allows two sample
loops recorded at different tempos to be used in the same piece of
music. Phrase samples can be ""Sliced,"" or divided up at the rhythmic
peaks of the sample. Once sliced, individual samples can be muted to
generate new grooves. Pitch, filter and effect settings can be applied
to the individual sliced samples (or Motion Sequenced) to transform the
original phrase into something unique. Two Accent parts introduce added
dynamics. Reverse and Roll commands can be used to quickly generate

multi-feature device. It can sample, apply effects and offers some basic
drum and synthesizer sounds. Some will say that none of these features
are exceptionally good—and they're probably right. But, the
strength of this device is its ability to be versatile and notably
intuitive. By simply touching, tapping or sliding your finger over the
large touchpad, you can control multiple effects parameters and
manipulate samples in real time.The sampling side of the KP3 is easy to figure out. Four samples (or
phrases, because the KP3 is really of the 'phrase-sampler' ilk, rather
than a traditional  sampler) can be stored. The sampling time is 16
beats at 74 bpm—suggesting that the maximum sample time is about
13.2 seconds for each pad at 16-bit, 48kHz stereo. You can sample at 74
bpm or higher at beat values of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 per measure. Each
sample can be a continuous loop or a one shot sample. Recording a sample
is easily done by pressing ""sampling"" and then the pad you want to
record to. It's that easy. The only draw back for some will be the fact
that it only has RCA-style jacks for all incoming and outgoing
audio.Now the for best part: the effects! This section is incredibly
intuitive because of the large centrally located X/Y touch pad. Effects
are selected with a knob (there are 128 programs to choose from). The
types of effects offered vary widely and can be used for a range of
creative possibilities. From grain shifters, slicers, LFO modulation,
echo, reverb, flanger, delay, filters to various combinations. Eight
memory locations are provided above the touch pad to store your
favorites, along with any pad motion recording, pad hold status and
position, plus values for fx depth and fx release. Also, another
attractive point of the KP3 is its ability to apply effects to the input
of the unit, with or without samples playing back, effectively using it
as a real-time effects processor. As this device begs to be used live,
it does a great job at sampling the input or re-sampling the output on
the fly. Another nice extra is the ability of the KP3 to provide a tap
tempo and it has auto-BPM detection to beat-sync its tempo to the input
(sometimes the sync is sloppy but you can help it by tapping the tap
tempo button, indicating to the KP3 where the beat is). This tempo can
be output in MIDI to clock other devices, as well as any button you push
or activity on the touch pad can transmit/receive MIDI for the option to
record and playback your performances in a sequencer.Another interesting thing is, for the first time, the KP3 can save
all its memory to an SD card. You can't name the samples, they are
numbered from 00 to 99. You can also save all the data (the 8 effects
locations, samples, global settings) into 1 of 10 possible memory
locations on the SD card. All of this information can also be created or
edited via the included KP3 editor/librarian software via USB connection
to your computer.Whether you are in a studio, live, a pro or not, the KP3 begs to
shape, re-shape, bend and loop your music in an immediate and intuitive
way.The KP3 was preceded by two earlier generations:Korg KAOSS Pad
1Originally released in 1999, the KP1 featured up to 6 available
effects at a time (instead of 8 on the newer models) and lacked any
sampling ability or basic synth tones. It was, for all intents and
purposes, a DJ-oriented, real-time effects processor and MIDI-controller
with an immediate hands-on or touch-style approach, a super simple
layout and lots of cool lights!Korg KAOSS
Pad 22002 brought the KP2 which added a phrase-sampler with 12
seconds of 44.1kHz sampling and synth and drum sounds derived from the
ElecTribe series. Memory, I/O and even the touch-pad all received
upgrades from the original unit as well.",

The knobs and buttons that adorn its surface access most of the crucial parameters of sound design, including a large knob for filter cutoff and dedicated displays for oscillator and filter selection.The heart of the KingKORG is Korg's XMT, supplanting the MMT that drives the MicroKorg. XMT provides 3 oscillators and 1 filter per Timbre, and 2 Timbres per Program, which can be split or layered. The oscillator selection contains a comprehensive set of classic analog waveforms as well dual, unison, sync and ring modulated variations, although these eat into the 24-note polyphony. Also included are noise (white, pink, blue, and resonant), FM-like VPM, an expanded set of DWGS oscillators, and a well-selected set of PCM samples including Mellotron, Wurlitzer, strings and choirs. The final selection allows the Mic in port to feed in to the filter, allowing for external oscillators. Alternately, the mic can be used to drive a 16-band vocoder.Korg has provided 18 different filter selections, modeling Moog, Oberheim, Prophet, MS-20 and TB-303 filters. These are provided in low, high, and band-pass arrangements. Also included are KingKORG's native filters in both 12 and 24 dB/oct variants. Cutoff sweeps are smooth and stepless, via both the cutoff knob and modulation sources.</p> <p>Modulation is delivered via a Virtual Patch system to connect the 2 LFOs and 2 ADSR envelope generators (among other sources) to a myriad of destinations, including other virtual patches. The midi-syncable LFOs provide triangle, sine, saw, square, sample + hold, and random waveforms and run up to 100Hz. They have dedicated depth knobs to modulation routings to filter cutoff and Timbre pitch. Likewise, the EGs have dedicated routings to filter cutoff and amp level. A configurable 8-step arpeggiator provides some hands-off note generation to permit knob twiddling.Three effects modules provide additional sonic tools, and can be applied to either or both of a Program's Timbres. The PRE section includes ring modulation, guitar and EP amp modeling, decimation, distortion and tone. Next, the MOD section provides a chorus, U-Vibe, tremolo, rotary, phaser and flanger. Finally, the REV/DELAY section has room, hall, and plate reverbs, as well as a straight and stereo-panning delay, and a tape echo simulation that sounds fantastic. There is a global stereo tube preamp with boost, as well as a configurable 2-band parametric EQ.</p> <p>A strange addition is a CV/Gate output that can be configured for Hz/V or V/octave, allowing the KingKORG to interface to modular gear. Sadly lacking are aftertouch and a step sequencer that would help the KingKORG meet its performance-oriented billing.",
Korg,KPR-77,11567,http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/kpr77.php,3.38,2,1983,n/a,0,1,1,0,0,"{'Polyphony': '6 voices', 'Sounds': 'bass, snare, hi/low toms, open and closed hi-hats, accent and (switchable) cymbal/clap', 'Controls': 'Tempo, Volume, Level per drum part and Accent', 'Patterns': '3 Banks x 16 patterns (48 total)', 'Songs': 'Two', 'Keyboard': 'None', 'Effects': 'None', 'Control': 'DIN SYNC (48ppqn) IN/OUT, Trigger Outs from Toms', 'Date Produced': '1983'}","The KPR-77 was Korg's answer to the TR-606 drum machine. Like the 606, the
KPR-77 is basically an analog machine. Its sounds consist of bass,
snare, two toms, open and closed hi-hats, accent and (switchable)
cymbal/clap. Each drum sound's level can be individual mixed via the
sliders. Unfortunately the KPR does not sound nearly as nice as the 606
can. But it has a simple LCD programming display sort of like what the
TR-505 sports.It holds up to 48 patterns (3 groups of 16) and two songs. A pattern can
hold up to 32 steps. Like the TR-606, the KPR can be battery operated
and REQUIRES batteries for retention of your programmed drum patterns
and songs when it is turned off! Fortunately a casette out lets you
store its memory to tape for offline storage. The KPR-77 has DIN SYNC
IN/OUT as well as Tom trigger outs (like the 606) for external control
and triggering. However, Korg's DIN Sync is not the same as Roland's
DIN Sync. When syncing Roland and Korg gear via DIN sync, they will work
however the Korg machine will run at 1/2 the tempo/speed of the Roland
unit. This is because Korg uses a 48 ppqn (parts per quarter note) DIN standard whereas Roland's
is 24 ppqn. This can be corrected with several devices which will
translate 24-48 sync, such as the Korg KMS-30.",
Korg,Lambda ES50,11341,http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/lambda.php,3.74,4,1979,n/a,0,1,1,1,1,"{'Polyphony': '48 notes', 'Oscillators': '3 top-octave generators', 'Waveforms': 'Divide-down pulse waves', 'LFO': 'Tremolo and Vibrato; pitch bend', 'Filter': 'Fixed filter banks for each preset; extra VCF for Brass', 'Envelope': '2 simple envelopes per key; 1 preset filter env for Brass', 'Effects': 'Analog chorus', 'Keyboard': '48 keys; no velocity or aftertouch', 'Memory': '9 preset sounds', 'Control': 'Keyboard trigger out, sustain  and expression pedal inputs', 'Date Produced': '1979 - 82'}","The Korg Lambda is a fully polyphonic 48-key preset synthesizer released
in 1979. It features two types of sound - Percussive (Electric Piano,
Clavi, Piano, Harmonics) and Ensemble (Brass, Organ, Choir, Strings I,
Strings II). The Percussive sounds have a simple fast attack and
variable decay envelope, and the Ensemble sounds have both preset and
variable attack/release envelopes. Each key is articulated
independently, so there is no note-stealing as experienced on synths
limited to a handful of voices. The downside of this is the relative
lack of programmability, but the presets sound good, particularly when
layered (they are all available simultaneously).The Lambda uses divide-down technology from three Top Octave oscillators
to provide the basis for its sounds. The three oscillators are mixed and
filtered using fixed circuits to create the preset sounds, but there are
also controls on the front panel for basic low-pass filtering of the
Percussive and Ensemble tones, and each section has its own volume
control. There is also a control for ""click"" (used to add
attack to the EP sound) and a filter cut-off control for the Brass
sound, which has its own paraphonic filter - tuned to give a slightly
resonant peak to the sound, and with its own preset filter envelope.
This re-triggers on every keypress, so held notes will also be reshaped
when new ones are played. In practice this is not much of a problem.An Octave switch puts the keyboard in regular or Octave Down mode. The
three oscillators can be detuned to thicken the sound further, and there
is a separate analog ""chorus phase"" (really just a chorus) for
each of the Percussive and Ensemble sections. These can be switched
on/off independently but share the same sweep control, which is via the
joystick on the modulation panel to the left of the keyboard. The
joystick also acts as a pitch bend control. Vibrato can be switched off
the Ensemble sounds. Percussive sounds feature a variable Tremolo and a
Sustain switch that turns Decay into a Release.Round the back, there are plenty of interface jacks for a synth of this
type. Aside from the headphone out, the mono mix out, and the stereo
outputs, there is a short-to-ground Keyboard Trigger output, a Sustain
pedal input, and an Expression input jack, switchable between
Percussive, Ensemble, or both.The Lambda is a solidly-built instrument, and its large top panel is
perfect for laying out some effect pedals and/or a mono-synth. Despite
its preset nature, the Lambda is a more versatile synth than it might at
first appear, partly due to the quality of its sound, but also the
simple yet useful modulation and tone-shaping controls. It really shines
through a phaser and some reverb, and is eminently playable.",

instruments! Korg has recreated some of their most beloved and classic
synthesizers here as software plug-ins - the MS-20 mono-synth of the 1970's, the super
fat Polysix analog synthesizer and the
ground breaking Wavestation
digital synthesizer. Using Korg's own CMT (Component /modeling
Technology) these virtual instruments sound as good, if not better
than the originals. The Legacy collection is simply a must-have for any synthesist.
The Limted Edition 84% scale MS-20 replica controller is worth the price
alone! This USB/MIDI controller lets you feel like you’re editing and
patching on the real thing - and it's compatible with any virtual
instrument! The fourth plug-in in the bundle, Legacy Cell allows
you to combine the MS-20 & Polysix plug-ins for even more dynamic
and exciting sounds! Stand-alone operation via ASIO or Core Audio as
well as RTAS and VST/Audio Units make it at home in almost any computer
workstation.Starting with the MS-20 plug-in, it fully replicates the front panel
design of the original, complete with patch cables. Korg's CMT tries to
replicate every part of the original, every transistor, resistor, etc.
to virtually recreate the MS-20's circuitry and thus - its sound! The
MS-20 sounds great, it's fat, buzzy, resonant, and (unlike the original)
very clean and stable. Excellent for today's standards but still with a
truly analog character and warmth. The original MS-20 was monophonic
but polyphony is now available up to 32
voices with unison, de-tune and spread modes. Every knob and patch can be
tweaked via MIDI or the MS-20 controller. It's fun to watch any physical
patch connections you make on the MS-20 controller appear on-screen in the
plug-in - in real-time! And every patch you create (unlike the original)
can be saved and stored to disk. It ships with a slim 32 preset patches to get
you going, but creating your own patches is what it's all about!The Polysix was Korg's answer to Roland's Juno-series, and it was one of
their nicest and lushest analog synthesizers of the 1980's. Now that
it's virtual, it's still as lush and warm as the original. The original
was only 6-voice polyphonic, but the plug-in has stepped things up to 32
voices, also with unison, de-tune and spread modes. The LFO and
Arpeggiator can be synchronized to MIDI clock. True to the original, the
plug-in ships with built-in chorus/ensemble effects and 32 presets, but
you can create tons more of your own. Additional close-up Edit Views of
the Polysix let you get into tweaking the sounds, but you can also use
the MS-20 controller or any other MIDI source too.The previous plug-ins are pretty nostalgic and fun. But the Wavestation
really stands out here (just as the original did when it was introduced
back in 1990). First, it offers a major update to user-friendliness in
its programming interface that makes creating your own sounds much easier. But
you may never need to get into editing your own as it ships with 550
presets covering a whole range of inconceivable sounds! What's more,
performances, patches, and wave sequence data created on original
Wavestations can be loaded into this plug-in via System Exclusive MIDI
messages! The Vector Joystick of the original is here (and MIDI
controllable) to mix together in 2-dimensions the four oscillators (A,
B, C, & D). Various edit page views allow you to delve deep into
tweaking wave sequences, performances (groups of patches), patches,
zones, and more. It's almost too complex to get into here, but the
Wavestation plug-in alone is an amazing resource of superb sounds from
natural instruments to bizarre drones and textures that will set your
music apart from others. Simply stated, these plug-ins are everything
their original counterparts were...and more! The Wavestation plug-in,
for example, uses the same digital coding as the original, but the
original had a 32kHz sample rate and the new plug-in supports 44.1
through 96kHz - simply awesome!As if all this isn't enough, Korg also included Legacy Cell, a
Performance based plug-in that lets you freely combine two instances of
the MS-20 and/or Polysix together along with a dual-effects processor
for even more dynamic and unique sonic creations! It offers 127 presets 
with plenty of room for your own combinations. The MDE-X effects
processor offers everything you could want from reverbs and delays to
distortion and even the MS-20's filter section is available as an
effect. A virtual Korg microKontrol is built-in to the Legacy Cell
too for real-time assigning and manipulation of any editable parameters,
and it works instantly with a real microKontrol too!
The bottom line with this whole package is great plug-ins, great sound,
great results, great price!In 2007, Korg released a new bundle called the ‘Legacy Collection Analogue Edition’
which added the classic Mono/Poly and M1 synthesizers to the line-up.The Mono/Poly was a monophonic behemoth with polyphonic capabilities
that many musicians acclaimed as the best analog synthesizer Korg ever
made. And they’ve improved its functionality in software by adding eight
powerful virtual patches for near infinite modulation routing, two
integrated multi-effects, 16-voice unison and up to 128 voices. The
Mono/Poly offers four full banks of rich, fat sounds, covering
everything from deep basses to soaring leads; fine arpeggiator patterns
to riveting soundscapes. And you’ll never get lost looking for sounds,
using the Mono/Poly’s simple category select feature.In 1988, the M1 created the workstation category and went on to become
one of the top selling keyboards of all time, easily surpassing an
amazing 100,000 units. The M1 software synthesizer reconstructs the M1
into an eight-part multi-timbral tone generator featuring up to 256
notes of polyphony. Topping the list of software improvements are
variable filter resonance, two Insert effects per part, and two Master
effects. The M1 also contains all PCM, Program, and Combination data
found in the original M1 and M1EX PCM expansion sets, all 19 optional
ROM cards, plus the full sound set of the acclaimed T Series. Plus there
are plenty of new sounds – including some slammin’ drums. That’s over
3,000 sounds total!",

digital sounds and good buzzy techno sounds. The M1 is sort of like a
workstation-version of the Roland
D-50.In addition to its acclaimed sound, it has a somewhat sophisticated
8-track sequencer. It holds 10 songs and 100 patterns and up to 7,700
notes, and offers full quantizing and editing. Full MIDI implementation
suites the M1 ideally for studio production and MIDI system use. Up to 8
parts of multitimbrality with the 8 track sequencer makes for a powerful
machine. Add to that a host of digital multi-effects and you've got one
of the most widely and professionally used Korg synthesizers around.UPGRADES: The EXK-M1 optional ROM expansion kit doubles the PCM waveform

slightly bizarre matrix of pre-set sounds, including laughable woodwind
and similar noises and a low-quality keyboard all housed in a wooden
box!  It's a 32-note monophonic preset synthesizer with 6 push-button
presets including voice, synth1, synth2, brass, string, and wood. Its
single-oscillator design has only rudimentary decay/release envelope
controls and no access to the guts of the sound generation stuff.
Perhaps it was aimed at the beginners market.Once you're over the outward appearance, a bit of probing will reveal a
noise box that sounds remarkably similar to the MS-10 at times.  There is a lot of fun to be had
with the 'traveller' control, a sort of filter and resonance control
rolled into one, offering interesting squelchy acid-style bass run
effects. In fact, like the MS-10, bass is about
all you'll get out of this oddity in terms of useful noises. But overall
this is a bit of a novelty synth, and is not especially playable nor
distinctive - apart from its looks!  There are absolutely no MIDI, CV
nor similar inputs so you can forget about any of that. Add N To (X),

even a ring modulator. The Maxi-Korg is a great source of early Korg
sound that rivals competitors like the OSCar and Roland SH-synths. No MIDI, no memory, but
good bass and screechin' leads! It has no CV input either, though it can
be modified to accept externnal control from the less standard Hz/V
protocol (also used by Yamaha).Most people usually understand it best as two separate MiniKorgs inside
one keyboard with all the controls to both. Most people will stack both

It was released in 2007, along with its larger X50 sibling. Instead of being packaged in a cardboard box, every MicroX came in a durable, bright orange road case. That, along with its diminutive form factor, made it perfect for touring DJs and performers who were looking for lots of bang for their buck. The synth's small footprint also made it a handy edition to a home studio set-up, where it could pull double-duty as a MIDI controller, via a standard USB Type B port. Originally only available in black, a limited edition white model was also offered later.The MicroX featured a 64Mb Wave ROM. 32Mb contained the classic Triton waveset from the original workstation, while the other 32Mb featured new multi-sampled sounds and drum samples, many of which were unique to the MicroX. In total there were 642 multisamples and 929 drum samples, all of excellent quality, arranged into 640 preset patches. Like all Korg products of this time, those patches could be arranged into Combinations, 384 of them, which made it easy to set up layers and splits. The drum sounds could be organised into any of 40 kits. On top of all that, Korg also added a full GM soundset. With 62-voice polyphony, there were always plenty of voices for even the most complex layered combinations.The variety and amazing quality of the Wave ROM meant that every musical style was covered. Best of all, every parameter in the MicroX could be programmed by the user, a process aided by a software editor/librarian, both stand-alone and VST, that shipped with the synth. Programming from the front panel was also possible and made easy by a large, backlit display and an array of front panel knobs and switches. Navigating around the different sections of the synth engine was easy enough, considering the depth of programming on hand, although using the software editor was definitely preferable.The basic synth structure was that of a two oscillator, virtual-analogue synth, with plenty of modulation sources to tailor each patch very precisely. To get even more from the sound engine, the MicroX featured dual arpeggiators, with 256 user programmable memory slots, and an effects section that allowed up to four effects per patch/combination, from an available 89 different effects.All of this in such a tiny synth may seem fanciful, but Korg pulled it off brilliantly. You got everything that made the Triton workstation an industry standard in a tiny, portable package that was perfect for touring musicians and small home studio set-ups alike. Ultimately, it's biggest limitation was it's two octave, velocity-sensitive keyboard, which made split combinations and chords difficult. However, if you could live with just 25 keys, the depths of the MicroX's abilities would keep any synth player happily exploring its sonic possibilities for years.",

increasing need for hardware controllers to provide physical access to the functions
normally found on keyboards, mixer and effects units. Limited space
is a key issue for everyone using a desktop or portable computer for audio,
so a compact solution is ideal, hence Korg's entry into the busy world
of USB keyboard controllers populated by models from the likes of
Edirol, Evolution and M-Audio.The microKONTROL works well with many software products, including the
Korg Legacy package. It offers three octaves of mini velocity-sensitive
keys, eight control sliders with matching rotary controls and small LCD
displays, a combined modulation/pitch bend joystick, and a square of 16
velocity-sensitive drum or note trigger-pads doubling as selectors for
new setups, edit functions, sequencer Play/Stop/Record, and more. 
It draws power from a USB port but can also be battery or 9V AC
powered. It offers MIDI outputs for controlling external instruments as
well as software ones, and comes with a suite of editing software. The software lets you define, load
and save new setups, which is handy, as the microKONTROL only stores 12
setup memories. The factory presets include mixers for sequencers such
as Cubase, Logic and Reason, 
and editors for Novation V-Station, NI Pro-53 
and other soft synths and samplers, but the CD-ROM offers 50 setups
for handling other products from Waldorf, Steinberg, Arturia and many
more.Each small microKONTROL LCD shows the current controller data being
sent, but sheets of tiny silver stickers are supplied so you can label
functions. However, some of the deep editing possibilities become quite
complex - for example, the pads can enter either decimal or hex
information, but aren't numbered in a straightforward manner.Overall, though, the microKONTROL is a neat little piece of kit. It's
compact and playable, and the combination of keyboard, pads and joystick
offers endless possibilities. It makes access to all your music software
much simpler, but it's a pity it has so few onboard memories.",

since the decades-old VC-10! The microKorg has 128 Programs organized into 8 categories: Trance, Techno/House,
Electronica, DnB Breaks, HipHop/Vintage, Retro, SndFX/Hits, and Vocoder. The sounds
are great and inspiring. There is only 4-voice polyphony and only
one Program can be played at a time. But as a hands-on, real-time dance machine,
this really is all you need...one hand on the keys and the other on the knobs!The microKorg has two oscillators with 71 waveforms (7 simple analog
waves + 64 DWGS waveforms from the DW-8000),
a multi-mode resonant 12 or 24 dB/oct filter, 8-band vocoder, two ADSR
envelopes, 6-pattern arpeggiator, oscillator sync, ring modulation, two
MIDI-syncable LFOs, programmable multi-effects, and more! All knobs and
buttons send/receive MIDI controller data. External audio can be vocoded
and/or processed through the filter, effects and EQ via the included
microphone or standard 1/4"" stereo inputs. A built-in USB Interface
would have been nice for true lap-top portability, but is currently
absent. But in its affordable price range, the microKorg is an awesome
synth for beginners, DJs, and even the pros looking for a compact
performance synth with retro style, flexible programing and excellent
sounds!It's been used by Air, Atomizer, Bare Naked Ladies, Beck,
Prodigy, Yesterdays, The Killers, KMFDM, Royksopp, Owl City, LCD Soundsystem,
Jean-Michel Jarre, Nick Rhodes (of Duran Duran) and The Pet Shop

Korg. It is a dual-oscillator synth related to Korg's first monosynth,
the single oscillator MiniKorg-700. Most of the controls are located in
an odd place beneath the keyboard so as to make room above the keyboard
for a sheet-music stand. Some controls have bizarre names like Bender,
Traveler and Expand for the auto-bend, filter and envelope,
respectively.MiniKorg-700It has three ring modulators for some strange sounds and noises.
Sometimes a decent bass sound for techno music can be achieved using the
MiniKorg's hi-pass and low-pass filters. The two oscillators can be
de-tuned and they offer triangle, sawtooth and square waveforms. There
are some strange analog effects built-in as well such as portamento, a
rudimentary repeat-delay, auto-bend (bender), vibrato and Chorus and
Noise waveforms.This limited and quirky little synth is a nice collectors item but
rarely seen or used anymore. It has relatively no performance controls
like pitch/mod, but for ancient analog technology, this synth is quite
stable and reliable. It is still quite capable of generating a very
analog bass sound, thud, thump, growl or squeal. The wood side-panels
and large primary colored knobs and sliders are a sure sign of Vintage
status. It has been used by The Cure, ComaTeens, Kitaro, Human

It is, in essence, a Monotron and an analog drum machine in one box. On paper it sounds deceptively simple, but there is a bit more to it than that.
Let's start with build quality, and then move on into more sound-related topics. The case is metal, which is a pleasant departure from the Monotron's Happy Meal plastic case. The knobs are, while a bit on the wobbly side, bigger and easier to grasp than the tiny ones found on the Monotron. The quarter-inch audio out is nice as well, and gives one the feeling that they are indeed playing a real musical instrument. It does not feel like a toy. The speaker on the underbelly of the unit is small, and not very loud, but it works in a pinch, and if it's not enough, use an amp. That's what the audio out is for.
Korg have taken the simple VCO architecture found in the Monotron and expanded it; now offering sawtooth, triangle, and square waveforms, as well as rock-solid pitch stability (it is actually not possible to detune the oscillator) and an octave switch that offers a range from 64' all the way up to 2'. Alongside the VCO, Korg have also outfitted the Monotribe with a white noise generator, useful for crafting custom percussion tones or just adding a bit (or a lot) of grit to your sound. Also present is a more sophisticated (though rudimentary) amplitude envelope generator than the simple gate on/off found on the Monotron. As the player, you have three separate EG shapes to switch between: ramp down (lending itself to more percussive, plucked, or piano-esque tones), gate on/off, and ramp up (attack at about 50% and sustain at 100%). Having three envelope types to choose from certainly is a limitation, especially for those accustomed to the standard ADSR found on other analog synthesizers.
The minuscule pitch ribbon controller found on the Monotron has been carried over to the Monotribe, much to the chagrin of keyboard players everywhere. This, however, could be seen as a limitation that forces one into a playing style unique to these instruments. Something Korg have done to remedy this obstacle, however, was to include the ""range"" parameter switch. We have the option to choose between three functions: ""wide"" sets the ribbon to cover a broad range of frequency, from borderline-LFO range frequencies at the bottom to high-pitched screeches at the top. ""Narrow"" sets the ribbon to an accurate scaling of the printed keyboard, while still allowing you to glide smoothly between notes. Finally, setting the switch to ""key"" quantizes the ribbon to match the printed keyboard, giving you pitch-perfect stability, and turning the smooth legato of the ""narrow"" setting into a glissando reminiscent of Dubreq's Stylophone.
The LFO is technically rudimentary but is, in practice, wildly versatile. Three waveforms (saw, triangle, and square) can be routed to modulate the frequency of either the VCO or VCF, or both simultaneously. You are able to toggle LFO frequency ranges between fast, slow, and 1 shot, which acts as a second (still quite basic) envelope generator. The LFO, when set to ""fast"", is capable of venturing far into the audible frequency range, so much so that by playing a bit with the ""rate"" and ""intensity"" knob settings, one can coax almost formant filter like tones out of the Monotribe, as well as some sounds that emulate things like oscillator hard-sync or ring modulation. I personally created my own sample library of drum sounds which I obtained exclusively from the Monotribe, and was amazed at the tonal variation I was able to achieve simply by playing with the LFO rate knob while set to ""fast"".
The filter design is the same as the one found in the Monotrons, and of course, the MS-20. It is 24db/octave, which provides us with a very steep cutoff slope, good for aggressive sweeps and introducing weird harmonic content with the utilization of filter resonance, or ""peak"" as it is referred to on the front panel.
The sequencer is simple. Very simple, in fact almost Zen-like in practice. This is a good thing, so long as you aren't expecting something comparable to what Elektron are known for. With no MIDI, it is important to have easy access to creating a musical sequence without having to adjust a potentiometer and wait for your sequence to cycle round for the twelfth time to ensure that you've tweaked the pitch to a note that fits in with the others in the sequence. This SH-101 style of sequencing is becoming more and more popular with today's current batch of analog monosynths, and it is very much welcome.
Korg's Monotribe is, along with being an analog monophonic synthesizer, an analog drum machine as well. This section is mind-numbingly simple, so let's dive right in. We have a kick, a snare, and a hat. That's it. 8 steps for each drum, and programming is easy. If you want to lay down a basic 4/4 kick, click the button labeled ""BD"" (Bass Drum), and select steps 1, 3, 5, and 7. Want it in half-time? Disable steps 3 and 7. Want a steady hat roll? Select the button labeled ""HH"" (Hi-Hat), and light up steps 1-8. It's easy, no-frills, no cusomization, dry-toast access to analog drums. Now bring in your synth sequence by cranking the VCA volume, and you've got a classic Berlin-school electro track! Congratulations, you're a musician!
I want to take a moment here to say that, while I do realize that the Monotribe is a very basic, introductory-to-synthesis type thing that synth freaks buy for their kids or girlfriends, it has a distinguished personality and injects an intense flavor to every track I use it on. The oscillator is bright, raspy, and buzzy. The filter growls, gurgles, and howls; and the sequencer is a blast to play with. I believe Korg may have created the Monotrons/Monotribe solely for the purpose of guaging interest in analog synthesizers, but they are in their own right very useful and musical in nature. Korg have outdone themselves in the department of providing incredibly useful and unconventional sound possibilities in an affordable package, and I applaud them for that. Let's hear it for a mega-corporation who have not lost interest in making music fun above all else.",

analog synthesis in nearly thirty years. Marketed as the
""Go-Anywhere Analog,"" the Monotron is roughly the size and
shape of a cassette tape (for those of you who know what that is). At
its core, the Monotron is a (very) basic, but fun, battery powered
monophonic analog synthesizer. It has one voltage-controlled oscillator
that produces a saw waveform, one voltage-controlled filter, and one
LFO.Despite its apparent lack of sophistication, it is arguably quite
musical. The oscillator is controlled by a small one-octave ribbon
keyboard that spans a whopping 3.25 inches across the bottom of the
unit. Since playing melody lines on a caterpillar-sized ribbon
controller is haphazard at best, the Monotron is best suited for
external audio processing and sci-fi spaceship sounds. However, the
ribbon scale is adjustable, and the lowest setting scales the oscillator
to track the ""keyboard"" printed on the ribbon. This, along
with a little practice, should allow a player to perform simple melodies
on the instrument. The LFO, which, like the VCO, produces a saw waveform
that can be routed to modulate oscillator pitch or filter cutoff. The
speed of the LFO is indicated by a blinking LED inside the rate knob.Now, on to what may be the biggest selling point on the synth: the
filter. Where to start? An entire book could be written on the
MS-10/MS-20 filter,
and it is difficult not to get long-winded about it. This
legendary filter, now reincarnated in the Monotron, is back with its
signature bite. Capable of self-oscillation, the celebrated 12 dB/oct
lowpass filter is remarkably versatile and can produce a wide range of
tonal variation. When paired with the aforementioned LFO, it is sure to
provide endless hours of exploration and fun (often at the expense of
others). ""Thick"" is the best term that can be used in
describing its character: rich with harmonics, it is full of squeaks,
gargles and howls just waiting to be unleashed through a quick jerk of
the peak (resonance) knob and various tampering with the cutoff knob.
An eighth-inch Aux input jack lets you apply the filter to any audio source too.
The most notable limitations of the Monotron are the lack of any
kind of VCA envelope generator (no ADSR here), memory and MIDI/USB options.Korg Monotron DuoThe Classic Monotron has been followed up by three siblings: the
Monotron Duo, which adds a second VCO and X-MOD capabilities to the mix;
the Monotron Delay, which, in addition to its analog oscillator, filter, 
and LFO, adds a (digital) ""Space Delay""; and the Monotribe, which is
essentially an expanded Monotron with a VCO capable of producing not
just a saw wave, but also square and triangle waves. It also includes a
16-step sequencer and analog drum machine.Korg Monotron DelayThe Monotron's simplicity, price (around $50), and size make it ideal
for anyone who wishes to learn the basic concepts of analog synthesis
without blowing even a modest budget. Sure, the Monotron may look like a
toy to some. But where else can you get a Korg MS-20 analog filter, and
then some, for around $50? It makes a perfect pocket synth/analog effect
unit. Being battery powered and equipped with a built-in speaker, you
can take it anywhere for processing audio, or just having fun creating
analog synth sounds. In fact, they are inexpensive enough that it could
be worth getting a couple, allowing for some polyphonic synth action or
processing. The little Monotron series are really a useful addition to
any musicians tool box...or pocket.",

standard 1/4 inch patch cords to the VCF and VCA. It really is a
powerful little mono-synth with plenty of knobs and a compact 32-note

The MS-20 is the big brother to the MS-10. It is an analog two-oscillator monophonic lead and bass synth with hard wired and patchable connections. The hard-wiring can be overridden however, using patch-cords. This type of hard-wired but patchable design was similar to the ARP 2600 of the late seventies. Of course the 2600 was much bigger and better. But the MS-20 offered a lot of flexible control and great sounds at a more affordable price. In addition to two analog oscillators, the MS-20 featured two resonant VCFs (filters), two VCAs, sample and hold, a noise generator, an assignable mod-wheel and lots of knobs! The VCF (filter) section is capable of high-pass, low-pass, notch and band-reject which is unique and different than your basic lowpass style filter. External sound sources can be routed through the filter section as well. In fact William Ørbit uses the filter in his MS-20 relentlessly to filter and tweak his samples, beats, delay returns, vocals, etc.There's also a Pitch-CV converter for triggering sounds from external sources. Aphex Twin makes quite a bit of use of this, feeding the input stage of his MS-20s with drum sounds and other untrackable audio to get the synth to make a wide variety of crunch/squawp/screech noises by mistracking the filters, etc.As for its sounds, the MS-20 sounds great! It makes a great alternative for Minimoog-seekers. The MS-20 is great for just about any type of analog synth sound you could want! Fat round bass sounds, percussive bass or sounds, noise effects, squiggly-bubbly sounds or sinuous-worm leads are all waiting to be unleashed from inside this classic beast. The MS-20 is not only a great sounding instrument, but a great learning-synth.

Until now, that is. Korg's most famous and coveted monophonic synthesizer is the MS-20, first introduced in 1978, and it has been reborn as the MS-20 mini. Korg enlisted the same engineers who designed the original MS-20 to recreate it in a body that is smaller by 86% of the original size, but looks and sounds the same. This is an authentic reproduction of the original specifications of the MS-20, and it delivers the same powerful sound, from deep, growling basses to crisp, rounded leads.The MS-20 mini has the exact same synthesis as the original: two analog oscillators with ring modulation, and envelope generators with delay and hold. The VCA (Voltage Controlled Amp) maintains the original basic design, but has been modified to produce less noise.Best of all, the powerful MS-20 filter is alive and well in the MS-20 mini, providing both high-pass and low-pass with peak/resonance. This is the same reincarnated version of the filter that was also used on Korg's Monotron and Monotribe. Of special note, half-way through the production lifecycle of the original MS-20, the filter circuit was changed; the MS-20 mini uses the earlier KORG35 filter circuit which has been considered the better version of the two. The ESP (External Signal Processor) allows external audio signals to be used with the MS-20 mini, just as the original allowed. For example, the pitch or volume of an external audio source could be used to control the synthesizer. The distinctive and flexible patching system enables the creation of complex sounds by allowing the rerouting of both modulation and audio (both the internal oscillators and external audio). Flow-charts printed on the front panel (meticulously reproduced from the original) help users of any experience level understand how to route signals and produce a variety of sound possibilities. The most obvious difference between the Mini and the original, is the size. It is 86% of the original size, and the 37 keys of the keyboard are mini-keys. Patch cables/plugs have also been shrunk down from 1/4"" phone-plugs to 1/8"" mini-plugs. The other major difference is the MS-20 mini is equipped with a MIDI IN jack for receiving note messages, and a USB-MIDI connector that can transmit and receive note messages from a computer and/or external sequencer. It should be noted that the MS-20 mini only responds to note messages; controller changes were excluded from the MIDI spec because they would not give you the smooth, un-stepped parameter changes associated with actual hands-on knob tweaking.Korg also packaged the MS-20 mini in a manner that replicates the original, and included the original MS-20 owner's manual and settings chart. Buyers of the MS-20 mini are not getting a run-of-the-mill Korg synthesizer exploiting the namesake of its vintage Icons. The MS-20 mini is an MS-20, inside and out, with the added MIDI and USB functionality needed to make it talk to modern studio equipment right out of the box. Amazingly, it lists for only $599 USD!",

Yes, this sounds as good as it looks! Remember Korg's MS-series (the MS-10, MS-20 and MS-50)? That's right, the MS or MonoSynth series are some of Korg's most sought after analog synths. They were some of the only compact Patchable monosynths of their time, and had a great Korg sound too. While the MS2000 is somewhat ""hard-wired"", it offers just as much and more flexibility while maintaining a straight forward and hands-on approach towards old-fashioned editing via dedicated knobs, buttons and flashy lights. In place of actual patch cables and input jacks, the MS2000 features a cool ""Virtual Patch"" mode in which signal can be routed to various sections of the synth (ie: LFO, Filter or Keyboard Velocity) using the LCD display and paging through various screens. The MS2000 actually comes up against the similar Roland JP-8000 and Novation SuperNova & Nova synths. Despite its amazing look, the MS2000 has some surprising limitations. It has only 4-voice polyphony so you won't be creating very lush or complex pads and sounds with it. In spite of this, its sound is clean, crisp and very flexible. It can easily conjure up beefy basslines, sub-basses, wonderful sweeping leads, pads and hits. Classic features include a 6 pattern arpeggiator, a very flexible LFO with sample and hold and even vintage wood side-panels and printed block diagrams and programming data on the face.Programming seems just about as classic as its look. The two oscillators offer up to eight waveforms plus noise. A great self-oscillating filter section provides 12dB high and band pass filtering and switchable 12 or 24dB low pass filtering. A typical set of Envelopes modulate the filter and amplifier. Extensive modulation is provided by the two LFOs. A 16-band Vocoder section (a la VC-10) is also on-board and it does an excellent job! There are also on-board effects which include chorus, flange, phaser, delay, distortion and EQ. It also features a ""Modulation Sequence"" mode which is a 16-step pattern or sequence you create in either step- or real-time and any tweaking or editing can also be recorded into the pattern to add movement to it. The MS2000 is a very well designed and flexible synth with a look and functionality that not only honors but transcends its classic predecessors. It is used by BT, Depeche Mode, Apollo 440, The Crystal Method, Placebo, the Faint, Royksopp, Adrian Belew, Jean-Jacques Perrey, Saga, Klaus Schulze, Rick Wakeman, Yes, Yesterdays, Keith Emerson and Snoop Dogg. The MS2000R is, of course, the rackmount version of this beast. Although there is no keyboard and no real need for one, the 16 function buttons on the front of the unit can be switched into ""Keyboard"" mode in which they function as keys, mainly for demoing sounds while you're programming it. This is a really great feature since most rackmount synths either don't allow you to hear your progress from the actual unit or they only feature a one-note demo button to hear your sounds. The MS2000 is truly a well thought out instrument for musicians of any level looking for classic and new sounds within a quality digital synth with a sleek vintage look that'll turn a few heads!  Released in 2003 with an updated sound set, a sharp new black metallic color scheme and dedicated vocoder mic, the MS2000B and MS2000BR provide a combination of playability, expression and sound manipulation that is at once familiar, yet ready to open a new universe of possibilities. It is also worth mentioning that an MS2000 and MS2000B can be connected synchronously for eight voices of polyphony, as long as the two units have the same samples installed.  ",

It was somewhat of a step up from the Polysix, as it has 2 DCOs for
better reliability. It also retained the arpeggiator of the Polysix. The Poly-61 can provide cool gritty
basses or trippy analog sounds and fx.Also added is the familiar Korg joystick, which can be used to modulate
the VCO or the VCF. However, its filter only has 7 steps of resonance
and is not as fat as the Polysix's filter. It also uses the same method
of programming the Poly-800 and Yamaha DX-7 use, so it's not a very
useful synth for real-time-tweaking junkies. The first Poly-61s didn't
have MIDI, but the Poly-61M released in 1984 corrects this. Overall, the
Poly-61 is still a decent synth, and it can be acquired for practically
nothing! It has been used by FM Static and The Faint.",

The Poly-800 was comparable to the Juno-106, at the time, with respect to the fact that musicians now had access to affordable programmable polyphonic analog synthesizers (it listed for under $1,000) with memory storage, stable DCOs (digitally controlled oscillators) and a new state-of-the-art technology called MIDI (although there was no SysEx implementation yet).The Poly-800 is an eight-voice instrument (two more than the Juno series) with 64 memory patches (half of what the Juno-106 offered) and up to 50 editable parameters! Like the Juno, the Poly-800 had one DCO per voice, although it did feature a Double mode in which the oscillators could be stacked up for a fuller sound and only four voices of polyphony. The analog filter is a 24dB/oct low-pass which is shared by all voices (the Juno has separate filter chips for each voice). There's also a stereo chorus effect, chord memory, a simple built-in sequencer, three digital envelope generators (for the oscillators, the noise generator and the filter), and a funky joystick used to adjust the pitch, modulation and the filter.Unlike the Juno, which was still a “studio” instrument, the Poly-800 was built for the performer. With a light-weight plastic case (only 10 lb.), a couple low-profile sliders/knobs and only 49 keys, the Poly-800 can run on batteries and has guitar strap pegs so it can be worn like a keytar. A less common reversed color keys model was released for a unique look as well.EX-800In 1984, a keyboardless tabletop/rackmount version was released, called The EX-800. In both the Poly and EX models, all sound editing is accomplished by scrolling to a given parameter, described by little more than a two-digit number, and pushing the up or down buttons to adjust it. Fortunately every parameter’s two-digit numeric code and data-range is printed on the faceplate. Obviously, the Juno series has the edge over the Poly-800 when it comes to hands-on editing, however, some sort of external MIDI controller is usually sufficient to get more hands-on and real-time control.Poly-800 mkIIThe Poly-800 model was succeeded by the the Poly-800 mkII (pictured above) in 1985. The mkII added digital delay effects, MIDI SysEx functionality and a darker paint job. Note that the Siel DK70 is very similar to the Poly-800. Poly-800s have been used by Orbital, Depeche Mode, Sneaker Pimps, Vangelis, Geoff Downes, Nick Rhodes (Duran Duran), Yesterdays and Jimi Tenor.",

was manufactured in Japan by the Keio Organ company (aka KORG). However,
during this early period in KORG's history, the name of this synthesizer
has become somewhat confused. The KORG distributed units are named the
Polyphonic Ensemble and designated with the PE-1000 model number. Other
units were manufactured for Unicord, presumably as part of a
distribution deal outside of Japan, and they were named the
Poly-Ensemble ""P"" and designated with the K-4 model number.
There are no technical differences between these models, and in this
article we will refer to them as the Polyphonic Ensemble P.The Polyphonic Ensemble P was released in conjunction with the
Polyphonic Ensemble S (PE-2000/K-5). The two
instruments are quite different from each other, but were intended to
complement each other as a pair, with the ""S"" model being
designed around sustained sounds such as strings, choir and organ, and
the ""P"" model designed for percussive sounds such as acoustic
and electric piano, and clavichord.The Polyphonic Ensemble P was one of KORG's first polyphonic
instruments. Instead of using divide down oscillator technology to achieve full polyphony, the PE-1000
is one of a very few paraphonic (or polyphonic) synths from the 1970s 
which has a seperate oscillator per key, if not the only one, 
which makes it sound richer since detuning between octaves is possible
(that's what the Pitch Expand knob does). It offers seven preset sounds including String,
Pipe Organ, Brass, Piano, Electric Piano, Harpsichord and Clavichord. An
eighth preset called Control is basically a free synth mode with a
selection of square or sawtooth waveforms.Polyphonic Ensemble (PE-1000)The P model differs quite a bit from the design of the S model. It has a
larger 60-note keyboard (the S has 48 keys). The S model has a richer
sound due to the use of three oscillators whereas the P model uses a
single oscillator (per note) to create its seven preset sounds, each of
which are defined by preset values of the filter and the envelope
generator. However, it offers a lot more sound shaping features than the
S model. There is an ADS envelope generator, an LFO for Vibrato,
Portamento (Glide), and two resonant filters (high pass and low pass)
called the Traveler that can also be controlled via foot pedal. And an
ensemble/chorus effect can be created by adjusting the Octave Coupler (a 
super-octave oscillator one octave above the main osc) and the Pitch Expand controls.Like so many other orchestral synths like it, the Polyphonic Ensemble
P's sounds can fall short of sounding like the real deal. However, the
sounds it does create will be very familiar to listeners of classic
analog electronic music. The Polyphonic Ensemble P is a metal and wood
construction built into a rugged velvet-lined flight case. It has been
used by Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre.",

entire 48-note keyboard. It featured four preset sounds with two
variations each: String 1 & 2, Pipe Organ 1 & 2, Brass 1 &
2, and Chorus 1 & 2. A maximum of two preset sounds could be
combined together, ie: Brass + Strings. The sounds were generated by
three analog oscillators per note which gave it a much richer sound than
the PE-1000/K-4 model. However, very little can be done to modify the

and Bass are the only controls. Fortunately a nice Phase Shifter can be
dialed in to give the sounds some retro seventies shimmer.The Polyphonic Ensemble S is a metal and wood construction built into a
rugged flight case. It offered stereo output, a dedicated headphone output
with volume, and an expression pedal input. While it may not be the most 
flexible option out there, the Polyphonic Ensemble S's sounds are unique

are your thing. It has been used by Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream

the Ensemble effect. Instant Mellotron-like strings.Like the Mono/Poly the voices can be played in Unison for a 6-oscillator

Radias and the ultra-portable microKorg XL,
the R3 delivers sophisticated virtual analog power in a compact yet
sturdy package. Its 37 full-sized, velocity-sensitive keys and four
assignable knobs make it a lightweight yet flexible performance
instrument for shaping classic modeled sounds with a synthesis engine in
the spirit of the MS2000.The R3 is marketed as a ""Synthesizer/Vocoder"", and the
included gooseneck mic lets you take full advantage of its 16-band
vocoding capabilities right out of the box. Simply enter Vocoder mode
for access to all of the vocoder's variables that work with an internal
or external carrier signal. It also lets you record up to sixteen
7.5-second Formant Motion sequences, allowing you to play saved
phrases—albeit at a fixed tempo—through the vocoder without
external input. Whether you're looking to channel the spirits of sci-fi
robots, make a guitar do backing vocals or are in need of some
unconventional choral accompaniment, the R3's pro-grade vocoder earns
its place in both the mix and the title.Each of the 128 editable patches can contain up to two timbres, sharing
the somewhat meager polyphony between them. These can be layered or
divided across the keyboard and can be assigned to individual MIDI
channels. Each of these two timbres contain all the capabilities listed,
so despite being well suited for mono and lead styles it's possible to
get surprisingly complex, evolving pads which belie its 8-note
polyphony. This is best displayed when using each timbre's modulation
sequence, which lets you record a variable's knob changes and can yield
complex changes in a single key press. There's also a 6-mode arpeggiator
with a toggle button and latch control to further animate the sound.Every timbre consists of two LFOs, two oscillators, a wave-shaper with
sub-oscillator options, two insert effects, and three envelope
generators for filter, amp, and one for assignment using the Virtual
Patch system. This feature lets you define up to six additional
routings, giving the unit a fitting touch of modular dynamics which can
add subtle dynamics or make sounds spiral off into mayhem. Unfortunately
the routings are limited, but most of the logical sources and
destinations are included. The two oscillators cover a wide range of
traditional analog waveforms with some useful extras (osc1 includes 64
DWGS preset waveforms and the vowel-like Formant wave) and allow a
number of interactions between them: ring mod, VPM and unison, among
others. External signals can also be processed through the filters,
gates and effects. All of this is wrapped up with one master effect and
a variable 2-band EQ with some other fine-tuning mods to polish the
finished sound.All of this programming demands an intuitive interface, and although it
involves some menu-diving, this is handled by selecting the category
with a rotary encoder and then editing individual variables with the 4
main pots. Though it isn't ""per-knob"" editing, each pot is
encircled by a slick-looking LED halo which shows the value regardless
of the knob's current position. Each knob also has its own small LCD
screen which can show the variable or its value by hitting the shift
key. This combination along with the Original Value light takes much of
the drudgery and guesswork out of building your own patches, but it's
recommended to load up the included software editor since some
sub-variable and effects tweaks can seem cryptic at first.Overall, the R3 is a fun, good quality, affordable synth for anyone who
enjoys sculpting sounds using traditional subtractive synthesis, and
offers enough complex features and character to earn its place in the
mix. Great to program and built with portability in mind, the R3 has
what it takes to rock the stage!",

Oscillator #1 has nine basic waveforms, with four types of modulation and PCM (64 synth sounds, 128 drum sounds) and Oscillator #2 has four basic waveforms with two types of modulation. The Radias has the ability to stack up to five types of waveforms in Oscillator #1, while using only one voice of polyphony. In Unison mode, you can stack five additional waveforms, while using more polyphony. With this function, you can create some awesome super waveforms-the overall result can contain up to 25 detuned waveforms. The Radias also has two Low-frequency Oscillators (LFO) that add more modulation to the two audio oscillators. These LFO's provide six waveforms and their speeds can be set manually or by tempo. The Radias itself has four timbres per program. With a timbre, you can assign one drum program, another can have a lead, a bass, and a vocoder as well; all in one program! Each timbre can contain one synthesizer/drum kit, equalizer, and two multi-effects.The Radias has two filters that can be used side-by-side, individually, or in a series. They offer Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, and Combination modes. Each filter offers 24 or 12 dB modes for the low pass filter. The effects on this unit are remarkable as well. The Radias comes loaded with 33 different effects: Delays, Chorus, Flangers, Compressors, talking modulator, and even the good old Polysix Ensemble effect. You can assign one master effect to the program, while each timbre gets its own two effects, creating a whole world of possibilities. The Radias also offers a 16-band vocoder with a nice Formant Motion recording function that allows you to record up to 7.5 seconds of external audio which can then be triggered via the keyboard.The Radias has a built in arpeggiator as well, providing six different patterns to choose from. Patterns can be up to 32 steps long and the gate/velocity can be set for each step to get that sound you want! It also has two 32-step sequencers (they can be combined for a 64-step on a single timbre). They can easily be assigned to a drum kit, for example, to use the Radias as a programmable drum machine. The step sequencer supports 8-voice polyphony per step.  Overall, this synthesizer is a nice addition to anybody's set-up. It's a good virtual analog that is also quite good for the beginner to learn subtractive synthesis on. Korg also has excellent customer service, and the owner's manual for the Radias is very comprehensive and clearly explains its many functions. The Radias also has a software-based sound editor that is compatible with the newest versions of Windows and OSX. It has been used by Jordan Ruddess and Tangerine Dream.",

All together, there are 19 presets on it that give a variety of sounds. There are 11 presets for the ""Instrument"" section which include fuzz guitar, electric bass, clavi, string, flute, double reed, trumpet, hammered percussion, etc. And there are 8 presets for the ""Synthe"" section that give variable waveforms (square, pulse, sawtooth) in different pitch ranges (from 32' to 4'). Each preset has its own rotary control to vary its sounds. The Sigma is also unique for its ability to combine the synth and instrument sections for a nicer, layered synth sound or effect. While the synth section is nice, the instrumental sounds (tuba, trumpet, strings, guitar, etc.) are pretty darn bad, and only get interesting when mixed with the ""Synthe"" section sounds. Cool joysticks add multi-dimensional control. Use one to control pitch, noise and vibrato and use the second joystick to edit the low-pass and hi-pass voltage controlled filters! There is also an ""Effect"" section which is for Vibrato, Portamento, Sample and Hold, Noise, Key Hold, Multiple Trigger and Ring Modulator (each with it's own rotary control to vary it's sound). Even though it has a switch labelled ""Ring Mod,"" it's actually a cross-mod. It lets you cross modulate between the instrument and Synth sections.Ultimately, however, a basic design, limited edit-ability and a pure lack of memory and MIDI leave the Sigma far behind on the evolutionary scale (although it does let you play a quarter-tone scale). The Sigma has a metal music stand that slides out the back to hold your sheet music suggesting it may have been aimed at hobbyists, though it has been used by Jean Michel Jarre, Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson.

Use the knobs to adjust

24) but when you hook that up to your MS-10, 
MS-20 or MS-50 you can get
some pretty cool TB-303 like stuff
happening. Because the SQ-10 outputs CV (Control Voltage) it can also be
connected to the Oscillators, VCF (filter) or LFO's of your MS synths for
even cooler tricks. Using a CV / Gate converter allows you to use the
SQ-10 with other Roland, Moog, Sequential and even MIDI synthesizers.

The unit is easy to use; just press a program button to light its number on the simple LED display and it’s ready to play. The module features 16 note polyphony but with no filter, FX or envelopes to edit, sound creation is very limited. To extend the sonic pallet, users can layer and detune patches for some interesting combinations in multi-mode which can cater for up to 8 parts - each controlled via midi. System Exclusive can be used to store setups on an external sequencer. Parts can be independently routed via the two assignable jacks for mixing otherwise they function as a stereo out in basic play mode. The Symphony responds to modulation and channel after-touch for vibrato and these can be switched off if you so desire but it has an odd omission - no pitch-bend. A disappointing oversight from Korg you may think giving the fact that one of the patches is a guitar.Most of the onboard sounds are nothing special by today's standards and hardly symphonic in a classical sense. In fact, due to the now common PCM technology used for this module, it should have been best forgotten - and it would have been if it wasn't for the Chorus patch, which is easily its signature sound. It’s a choir sound that back in 1988 must have sounded very authentic. Even today in an age of gigabyte multi-sampled sounds at our disposable putting it through a decent reverb unit still does the business. Any interested musicians/producers should really check it out as well as the Organ patches and for anyone looking for a basic 80’s drum kit well the Symphony gives you that too. The Korg Symphony is not confined to its mere 9 patches; it has a single ROM card slot that can cater for the 4 cards that were produced for it; P3 Jazzcombo, orchestral, piano and pop which can also be integrated into its multimode setup.The Korg Symphony was marketed as an addition to Korg's Concerto digi-piano's but in 1988 its high price point and a measly number of patches put many musicians off – especially when they could easily buy the superior M1. Sadly where the M1 is easy to come by, searching for a Korg Symphony these days proves to be a little bit more difficult and with those ROM cards even more so. Fortunately, musicians still have access to its sounds as they are now in software via Korg's Legacy M1. Indeed the Korg Symphony looks like a distant cousin of the original M1, with the same shaped metal cover and black color styling.To sum it up, you could argue that the Symphony was Korg’s answer to a digital Mellotron for the late 80s - a very portable and reliable module giving you access to basic “bread & butter” sounds whilst leaving your high-tech synths to handle the more appealing sonic landscapes in your productions.

types, and LFO capabilities. The Brass section's VCF and Envelope
Generators are virtually the same as the Synthesizer section, allowing

well as faux-brass sounds. The String section has some unique features
as well such as a ""Bowing"" effect. Another unique effect included is a global flanger
that can self-oscillate! Flanger controls include Speed, Feedback,
Intensity and Manual.The Trident featured 16 user memory patches. In addition there were
three preset memory patches for Piano 1, Piano 2 and Clavi. There is no
way of externally playing the Trident with MIDI or CV/Gate without
modifications (CV/Gate only controls expression and filter parameters). 
But the CV/Gate inputs are discrete for each of the three sections.
There are also discrete mono outputs for each section and a mix output.The Trident mkII version released in 1982 had doubled the memory (32
patches), an independent envelope generator for the VCF (filter) section

It is a
beautiful, state of the art and superb sounding music workstation which
first appeared in 1995. Its most notable new feature to the synthesizer
industry is the super-cool 320 x 240 TouchView Graphical User
Interface....which is also the heart of the instrument! This workstation
seamlessly combines excellent digital sounds, in-depth yet intuitive
programming, real-time controllers, upward expandability and elegant
design to create the perfect all-around synthesizer.The Trinity's sounds come out of a 24MB ROM chip with 48kHz
multi-samples of about 375 sounds and 258 drums. You can even add an
expansion board of Prophecy sounds and Z1 sounds! There's a good digital multi-mode filter
with hi/low/band pass, band reject, resonance and more. There's also 110
effects for adding life to your sounds...up to 8 simultaneous insert
effects and 2 master effects.The Trinity has an excellent on-board sequencer allowing it to be the
center of your music studio...it's that good! And it's fun to use the
touch-screen. It's a 16-track sequencer with an 80,000 note capacity,
100 patterns and 20 songs. With the 32 voices and plenty of drum sounds,
you can use the Trinity as your all-in-one music studio! Great in the
studio, or live there are plenty of real-time controllers including a
Joystick, Ribbon controller and 2 assignable knobs and multiple sound
outputs. Expandability includes a SCSI port, Internal Hard Disk
Recording, 8Mb Flash Rom Playback-Sampler Option (which reads all Korg
and Akai sound libraries), Digital ADAT I/O option and the SOLO-TRI
Prophecy expansion board.Trinity PlusAnd now for the history... The original Trinity was
released in 1995 and had a hefty 24 MB sample ROM though it lacked some
of the features described above. Then, in 1996 the Prophecy sounds were
included in the Trinity Plus model. Following that came
the Trinity Pro which is basically the same as the Plus
but has a full 76 note keyboard. And if that wasn't enough there's
always the Trinity ProX which has 88 keys! And then came
the V3 series in 1998 (with its own entourage of Pro and ProX
keyboards). The Trinity V3 added all the
guts and glory of the Korg Z1 for even more outstanding musical sounds!
The benefit of the Prophecy and Z1 features is MOSS, Korg's
physical-modeling technique that made the Prophecy famous! The V3 or Z1
MOSS board can be added to the older Trinity models. At last it can be
said that the final Trinity is the new Triton, released in 1999.TR-RackA little late to the party, the TR-Rack was a rackmount member of the Trinity family
and was released in 1998. It offered the Trinity's ACCESS technology sound engine
in a much more affordable and compact package. It also bumped up the sound ROM to 32 Mbytes
providing twice as many Programs, Combis and Drumkits as the workstation model.The Trinity(s) has been used by Juno Reactor, David Holmes, Antiloop,
Dream Theater, A-Ha, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, Mike Oldfield, Kitaro,

production! It looks and sounds beautiful, and hiding under the hood is an extremely
souped-up synth-engine ready to tear up your tracks! Literally! It is a digital 62-voice
synthesizer with built-in sequencing and arpeggiators and an ultra-large touch-screen
control panel at the center of its face-plate.The Triton is in-fact an evolved Trinity...Korg's previous flagship workstation.
Whereas the Trinity was capable of 32-note polyphony, the Triton now boasts 62!
Waveform ROM has been expanded as well, now with 32MB of multi-sample sounds that
sound crystal clear and quite warm. With these samples and the Triton's in-depth programmability
you can create pretty much any sounds, from an orchestral flute with life-like vibrato
to all-out chord-stabs with filtering for dance-floor house music, complete with beats
and cool arpeggio patterns and phrases.Also on-board is a stereo-sampler. With 16MB RAM and space for up to
1,000 samples there's nothing you can't create with this synth. There
are plenty of on-board digital effects as well for sprucing up your
samples or the Triton's own internal multi-samples. Controllers include
a Joystick, 2 assignable switches, 4 assignable knobs, 3 arpeggiator
control knobs and inputs for a damper pedal, PC Interface Host and 2
audio-ins for the sampler section. There are also stereo outputs plus 4
individual outputs. A dedicated 16-track sequencer with a 100,000 note
capacity, Real-Time Pattern Play functions and an Arpeggiator with
several patterns round this beast out as a truly all-in-one music
workstation. The Triton is rivalled by the likes of Yamaha's EX5, Kurzweil K2500 and the Roland XP-80 comes close. But Triton makes for
a professional, versatile, elegant and superb synthesizer. It has been
used by The Orb, Orbital,
Depeche Mode, BT, Rick Wakeman,
Yes, Keith Emerson, Vangelis, Saga, Aqua, Royksopp and Apollo 440.Triton RackThe Triton Rack, released in 2000, has all of its keyboard
counterparts' sonic power, sampling functionality, intuitive operation,
and expandability. In addition, this two space, rack-mountable unit
dramatically expands the possible number of sounds by allowing for a
total of eight EXB-PCM expansion sound boards to be installed. It also
provides digital output and features numerous other functions that make
it the ideal choice for the musician looking for a no-compromise sound!Triton LEAlso in 2000, the Triton LE was released to give virtually all the same great
sounds and power of the original Triton at a much lower price. Its major
changes include the lack of the touch-screen interface (replaced by a
smaller LCD only screen), no more ribbon controller, and only one (instead
of five) insert effects. There is only one expansion slot for the Korg EXB-SMPL
sampling board. Internally, the sounds and synthesis engine remain
virtually the same, but a lot of the ""workstation"" features have been
side-lined to make the LE a cheaper and more standard type of keyboard
for less demanding entry-level or budget-challenged musicians. The LE
was offered in 61, 76 and a weighted 88 note keyboard models. Note that the
88-key model added a 16-MB Piano ROM to the standard 32 MB of waveform memory.Triton Studio2002 saw the introduction of the Triton Studio. This model made the 16 MB paino
ROM waveforms standard on all of its 61, 76 and 88 key models. Polyphony was
essentially doubled to 120 voices (2 banks of 60 voices). The Triton Studio also
added built-in S/PDIF input and output and could be fitted with an optional hard drive, 
CD-R/W drive or a ""Digital Interface"" board providing ADAT output and Word Clock.Triton ExtremeThe Triton Extreme was released in 2005. The most extreme model, it
quintupled waveform memory up to 160 MB with 120 voices of polyphony.
Most of the Triton series expansion boards have been pre-installed as
standard in the Extreme, while many sounds from the older Tritons have
been improved as well. Sample memory is also upgraded (up to 96 MB of
sample RAM). And in addition to its new ""paint-job"" a major feature was
the addition of a genuine 12AU7 ""Russian Bullet"" vacuum tube which could
be used as either an insert or master effect, or simply by itself to
allow for warmer, guitar amp-like sounds and for more extreme analog
overdriven/distorted sounds. USB connectevity has also been added for
direct computer interfacing to allow exchange of samples, sound
programs, sequences, and other Triton-compatible files through an
installable Compact Flash card, as well as for connection of a USB Hard
Drive or CD-R. Unlike the Classic, Studio, and Rack Tritons, the Extreme
can not be fitted with sample expansion boards due to the expansion ROMs
having been pre-installed. However, it is compatible with the MOSS
board.Additional Expansion Options for the Triton Series:
EXB-MOSS - the ultimate 6-voice DSP tone generator
EXB-SCSI - for external SCSI storage devices
EXB-mLan - digital audio and midi transfer for rack model

It is perhaps telling that, for a time, initially they could be a little hard to obtain (at sensible prices at least) due to the high demand.The audio signal path of the Volcas is analogue (except for part of the Volca Beats), but the control aspect is handled digitally.The Volcas are compact, being similar in size to an old VHS cassette. They have different, but complementary, colour schemes making them easy to distinguish at a glance. Construction is of rugged plastic, with a metal faceplate, rubber buttons and plastic knobs. Most of the smaller knobs are backlit.Whilst the three models share many features, there are subtle differences in the way some features are implemented in the different models. This means that, whilst the Keys and Bass look to be interchangeable (the polyphony of the Keys aside), they do function differently and what is possible on one might not be possible on the other.All three Volcas have a traditional five-pin DIN MIDI In connection, but no MIDI Out or Through. They also have sync in and out sockets, accepting 3.5 mm jacks, so that multiple Volcas can be tempo-synchronised.There is a quantised, touch-sensitive controller to play each instrument from the front panel, the controller doubling as a sixteen step step-sequencer and, via a Function button, providing switching for various auxiliary functions. There are eight memory locations for storing sequences.Each Volca has a small in-built speaker, rendering them fully self-contained which enhances their portability, although the speakers certainly do not do justice to the sounds the devices are capable of producing. For when you're not off the grid, the only sound connection is via a single, mono 3.5 mm out which doubles as a headphone socket.In addition to accepting six AA batteries, each Volca can also be mains-powered by a 9 V, centre-positive adaptor, but no adaptor is supplied. On start-up, lights under the touchpad keys give an indication of remaining battery life.As with the Monotrons, the circuit boards are clearly labelled, assisting the adventurous to modify the Volcas, for instance to add MIDI Out, audio input or control voltage inputs.The Volca Bass is a three oscillator analogue synthesizer. Whilst it is named and marketed as a bass synth, the Volca Bass has a range of six-and-a-bit octaves: its touchpad covers 16 notes, A to C, with an octave knob transposing the touchpad in one octave increments.On the touchpad, what are white notes on a traditional keyboard are black, enclosed by a gold rim, and sharps/flats are coloured solid gold. Lights within each touchpad ‘key’ indicate the note being played, whilst lights below each key indicate either the state of various functions accessed via the Function button, or the current step when sequencing. A four-character, segmented digital display provides information on many of the functions.Each oscillator can be switched between square and sawtooth waveforms (sadly, there is no pulse-width adjustment or modulation of the square wave). The oscillators can be tuned up or down relative to each other. Small movements of the VCO Pitch knobs will tune the oscillator in cents, to a total of 50 cents (a quarter tone). Beyond 50 cents, tuning continues in semitone increments to an octave above or below the midpoint. The oscillators are self-tuning, to overcome problems of pitch instability.The oscillators can be individually muted. They can also be grouped, with all three oscillators being controlled by a single internal sequence, two controlled by one sequence and the remaining oscillator by another sequence, or each oscillator controlled by a different sequence. However, despite it being possible to control the oscillators independently by the internal sequencers, it isn’t possible to use the Bass polyphonically from an external controller.The Volca Bass has a single low-frequency oscillator (LFO) capable of triangle or square wave modulation. The LFO can modulate the amplifier, oscillator pitch, filter cut-off or any combination of the three. There is a knob to control the LFO intensity for all LFO targets (no independent amount per target) and another to control the LFO rate, which can go well into the audio range to create interesting frequency/filter/amplifier modulation effects.The filter is a 12 dB/octave, resonant low-pass filter, a recreation of the one found in the Korg MiniKorg-700S from the mid-1970s. The filter is reputedly voiced differently to that of the Volca Keys, which is also modelled on the 700S. The filter cut-off knob is larger than the others on the synth, making it stand out so it is easy to grab quickly for filter sweeps. The resonance control is labelled Peak and the filter will self-oscillate at high resonance settings. However, as there is no keyboard tracking of the filter cut-off, the pitch of the self-oscillation is static and cannot be played (and the filter makes no sound when the oscillators are muted). At high resonance settings, the filter has quite an aggressive, screaming sound. At lower resonance settings the filter is less aggressive and warmer sounding.The Volca Bass has a single, very basic, envelope generator (EG). (Interestingly, the limitations of the EG are different to those of the EG on the Volca Keys.) There is a knob to control the speed of the attack phase of the EG, a single knob which controls both the decay and release portions of the envelope and another knob for the amount of control the EG exerts on the filter cut-off frequency. The sustain portion of the envelope can be switched on or off, but there is no control of the sustain level. (The Volca Keys has variable EG sustain level control.)EG control of the amplifier can be turned on or off, but there is no control of the degree to which the EG affects the amp. When EG control of the amp is off, the amplifier works with a simple gate on/off. (The Volca Keys only has gate on/off control of the amp.)Other controls on the Volca Bass include: master volume, sequencer tempo control and buttons for sequencer memory selection, play and record and other sequencer functions.The sequencer is inspired by Korg's former Electribe range. Sequences can be recorded in real time or can be entered step-by-step. (On the Volca Keys, the sequencer can only be programmed in real time – no step entry.) Slide is a feature that can be added to steps in the sequence, slurring between adjacent notes of differing pitch or tieing consecutive notes of the same pitch; the EG or LFO are not triggered after a slide.Unlike the Keys and Beats, there is no 'Motion sequencing', that is, only notes and Slide information is captured by the sequencer and changes to other settings are not.In ‘Active step mode’, individual sequence steps can be muted, either in real time for interesting polyrhythmic effects, or to allow sequences in time signatures other than 4/4.The Volca Bass is not without its limitations and drawbacks – inevitable given its size and price – but it is clear that thought and attention to detail have been expended on each of the Volcas individually, plus to the range as a whole, to ensure that these are not unduly limiting and that the three Volcas complement each other. The price, size, portability and sheer concentration of functionality are certainly very much in their favour.The Volca Bass itself is a great instrument, capable of producing a reasonably broad palette of interesting bass sounds. Aspects of its design and feature-set draw inevitable comparisons, no doubt as Korg hoped they would, with classic bass synths such as the Roland TB-303 Bassline. However, arguments as to whether or not the Volca Bass is an adequate substitute for that or any other machine, miss the point that this is a good synth in its own right.That comparison, and the emphasis on the sequencer, may cause some to pigeon-hole the instrument as targeted towards, or best suited to, particular genres of music – a situation not helped by Korg's own marketing and classification of it on their website as a DJ tool – and it would be unfair to do so.Neither the touchpad nor the sequencer may be the best ways of using the device for solos and lead lines, but the MIDI input provides the options of external sequencing by fuller-featured hardware or software or, crucially, of playing the synth from an external controller keyboard. So whilst marketed by Korg as an “analogue bass machine”, in reality, the Volca Bass is a capable – albeit limited – synthesizer, full stop.",
Korg,Volca Beats,11971,http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/volca-beats,3.24,4,n/a,n/a,0,1,0,1,0,"{'Multitimbral': '10 parts', 'Control': 'MIDI in (DIN), sync', 'Sequencer': 'up to 16 steps, real-time & step entry', 'Patterns': '8', 'Effects': 'Stutter (delay/retriggering effect)', 'Keyboard': '16-key multi-touch quantised ribbon controller'}","The Volca Beats is a hybrid analogue/digital drum machine. It has six analogue, synthesized voices (kick, snare, low tom, high tom, closed and open hi-hat) and four sampled (PCM) sounds (clap, clave, agogo and crash).The kick drum has three controls, for the pitch, the length of decay of the sound and the amount of ‘click’, which emulates the higher pitched sound of the beater striking the head of a kick drum.The snare also has controls for the pitch and decay. In place of the kick's Click control, the snare has Snappy, which varies the part of the sound that emulates the sound of the snare wires.The high and low toms each have a pitch knob, plus there is a global Decay control that affects the decay of both tom sounds together.The open and closed hi-hat sounds each have a decay control, plus there is a global Grain control, that affects the coarseness of the sound source.The four PCM sounds share a single knob for PCM speed, which affects the active sound individually, so that all four are independent. The knob controls the playback speed of the sample, allowing the crash, for example, to be slowed down so that it sounds vaguely gong-like.A single Part Level knob can be used to adjust the volume of the active instrument, allowing the level of the various sounds to be balanced with respect to each other. There is also a global Volume knob to control the overall output of the Volca Beats.The “Part >” and “Part <” buttons allow incrementing/decrementing to select a particular instrument, the selection being indicated by a light under the appropriate key on the touchpad. The Mute button allows a particular instrument to be muted, so instrumentation can be built up/broken down whilst looping a sequence.Stutter allows retriggering, either of individual sounds or globally, creating a delay-like effect on the affected parts. There are controls for the depth of the effect and the delay time. Using the Func button in conjunction with the Time control sets the delay time to divisions or multiples of a beat at the current tempo for more rhythmically perfect, less free-form, retriggering.Other controls on the Volca Beats include: sequencer tempo control and buttons for sequencer memory selection, play and record and other sequencer functions.The sequencer is inspired by Korg's former Electribe range. Sequences can be recorded in real time or can be entered step-by-step. (On the Volca Keys, the sequencer can only be programmed in real time – no step entry.) In ‘Active step mode’, individual sequence steps can be muted, either in real-time for interesting polyrhythmic effects, or to allow sequences in time signatures other than 4/4.Changes to either of the Stutter controls or the PCM Speed control can be recorded as part of a sequence: this 'Motion sequencing' is much more limited than on either the Keys or the Bass where many more knob twists can be recorded.The lights under each touchpad key light in turn to indicate the step currently being played, with one remaining lit to indicate the active instrument for editing, whilst the lights within each instrument key illuminate to show when that instrument sounds, for quick visual reference of the sequence.The Volca Beats is not without its limitations and drawbacks – inevitable given its size and price – but it is clear that thought and attention to detail has been expended on each of the Volcas individually, plus to the range as a whole, to ensure that these are not unduly limiting and that the three Volcas complement each other. The price, size, portability and sheer concentration of functionality are certainly very much in their favor.In the minds of many, any drum machine is going to be compared to numerous classic units. The Volca Beats has its own sound so will never be a replacement for such revered machines, except in the very broadest, most general terms. Neither are its sound going to cause any drummers to lose their jobs, but then that was never the case, nor the intention, with other rhythm boxes.The sounds the unit makes may not be to all tastes, but there is a useful selection of percussion instruments that would be expected on such a machine, with a reasonable degree of sound design available for the analogue elements, the PCM speed usefully broadening the range of timbres available from the sampled sounds.The Stutter effect and the PCM Speed control are useful sound-enhancing tools and the ability to have any length of sequence up to the full 16 steps broadens its appeal to those not working in 4/4 or who wish to create polyrhythms against other equipment running different length sequences. The sequencer and other controls mean that the Beats is at home either as a live tool or merely as a sound module under internal or external sequencing control.All in all, the Volca Beats is a useful (affordable, portable etc) drum machine with plenty of character.",

Whilst the synth has three note polyphony (the pitch of the oscillators can be individually controlled to play three notes simultaneously), it is paraphonic (the notes are not individually articulated, all three oscillators sharing a single filter and amplifier).The touchpad on the Keys is larger than the one found on the other two Volcas, being laid out like a traditional keyboard and spanning 27 notes, from F to G. Unlike the other two machines, the Keys does not have lights within each ‘key’ of the touchpad to indicate which note is being played.The lights below the touchpad, in addition to indicating the status of various functions and displaying the current step in the sequencer, also indicate the note being played with the two adjacent ‘white note’ lights showing when a sharp/flat note is played. Neither does the Keys have a digital display to show information relating to its various functions.Oscillators 
The two large knobs on the Volca Keys control the oscillator voicing and pitch. Oscillator Pitch uses footage nomenclature used in organ terminology, also favoured by Moog amongst others, and is switchable between 32′, 16′, 8′, 4′, 2′ and 1′.The oscillators produce both square and sawtooth waveforms, but the available waveform is governed by the oscillator voicing. The oscillators can be ring-modulated. The Voice knob selects between: polyphonic mode (sawtooth waveform; up to three pitches can sound); unison (sawtooth; all three oscillators play the same note); octave (sawtooth; two oscillators play the triggered note, the third sounds one octave higher); fifth (sawtooth; two oscillators play the triggered note, the third sounds a fifth higher).The Voice knob also allows selection of unison ring mode, where the three oscillators produce a single, ring-modulated note using the square wave, and poly ring mode, where there can be polyphony using ring modulation on the square wave. In polyphonic ring modulation (ring mod) mode, a single note will sound as a normal square wave without ring mod but as soon as a second or third note is played, ring modulation will occur. There is no pulse-width modulation of the square wave.The single Detune knob changes the pitch of the oscillators relative to each other. In Poly and Unison modes, the maximum Detune setting puts the pitch of VCO2 a semitone lower and VCO3 a semitone higher, in Unison mode this will result in the sound of two adjacent minor seconds. At less extreme settings, a more subtle, classic detuned oscillators sound can be obtained.The oscillators are self-tuning: if the tuning drifts, ceasing to play for at least 10 seconds will allow the auto-tuning function to correct the pitches.The glide time between note pitches is controlled by the Portamento knob. In Poly mode, a second note will glide up to pitch from the root and a third note will glide up to pitch from the second note. Portamento also works when a note is sustained and the Pitch knob is turned.The pitches of the oscillators can also be controlled by the envelope generator (EG) using the EG intensity knob. The way the EG varies the pitch of the VCOs varies with differing EG settings: at some settings the note will glide up to the correct pitch at note on, at other settings it rises upwards from the correct pitch at note on and then returns to it, at other settings the note pitch will only fall at note off.The low frequency oscillator (LFO) generates sawtooth, square or triangle waveforms and can be set to synchronise to note on triggers. The LFO can modulate the pitch of the oscillators, or the cut-off frequency of the filter, with a separate level control for each. (Unlike the Volca Bass, there is no LFO modulation of the amplifier level.) The LFO rate goes well into the audio range, allowing interesting frequency/filter modulation effects that can add useful distortion to sounds.Filter, amplifier and envelope generator
The filter is a 12 dB/octave, resonant low-pass filter, a recreation of the one found in the Korg MiniKorg-700S from the mid-1970s. The filter is reputedly voiced differently to that of the Volca Bass, which is also modelled on the 700S.There are knobs to set the filter cut-off frequency and the amount of resonance and, unlike these controls on the Volca Bass, the knobs are rather small. The resonance control is labelled Peak and the filter will self-oscillate at high resonance settings. However, as there is no keyboard tracking of the filter cut-off, the pitch of the self-oscillation is static and cannot be played. At high resonance settings the filter has quite an aggressive sound, but perhaps not quite as aggressive as that of the Bass. Unlike the Volca Bass, the filter cut-off frequency can be sequenced on the Keys.The Volca Keys has a single, very basic, envelope generator (EG). (Interestingly, the limitations of the EG are different to those of the EG on the Volca Bass.) There is a knob to control the speed of the attack phase of the EG, one to control the sustain level and a single knob which controls both the decay and release portions of the envelope. The knob to control the degree to which the EG affects the filter cut-off frequency is located with the filter cut-off and resonance, rather than with the EG controls, another difference between the Keys and the Bass.The EG does not control the amplifier level, which is a simple gate on/off. (On the Volca Bass the EG can also control the amplifier level.)In polyphonic mode, the amplifier and the filter envelope are retriggered each time a note is played, which can hinder certain playing styles.Sequencer
The sequencer is a loop sequencer, recording quantised or unquantised loops of notes from real-time performance. Unlike the sequencer in the Volca Bass or Beats, notes cannot be entered step-by-step. In ‘Active step’ mode, individual sequence steps can be muted, either in real time for interesting polyrhythmic effects, or to allow sequences in time signatures other than 4/4.Unlike the Volca Bass, variation of many of the parameters on the Volca Keys can be recorded with a sequence – dubbed ‘Motion sequencing’ – including changes to the filter cutoff, detune, portamento, EG control of the oscillators, LFO rate and intensity controls and the EG controls.The sequencer speed can also be changed to a half, or a quarter, that of the rate selected by the Tempo knob.The Volca Keys includes a metronome, which is a real boon given that the sequencer isn’t a step sequencer and only records in real time. Notes are automatically quantised, but free recording can be achieved in Flux mode.Delay
The Volca Keys also includes a delay, with controls for the delay time and the amount of delay feedback. The delay time can by synchronised to various subdivisions of the sequencer tempo. The character of the delay is quite gritty and low fidelity.Conclusion
The Volca Keys is not without its limitations and drawbacks – inevitable given its size and price – but it is clear that thought and attention to detail has been expended on each of the Volcas individually, plus to the range as a whole, to ensure that these are not unduly limiting and that the three Volcas complement each other. The price, size, portability and sheer concentration of functionality are certainly very much in their favour.Whilst there is not the degree of control over oscillator tuning that exists with the Volca Bass, the Unison, Octave and Fifth modes are useful for monophonic lead parts or basslines. The Keys is capable of making many pleasing sounds, although there is not quite the timbral variety that can be achieved with the Bass, due to the different modulation capabilities and the fact that a square wave can only be achieved by careful monophonic playing whilst in Poly Ring mode. Nevertheless, the ring modulation modes expand the sonic variety in a direction that is unique to the Volca Keys. The way that portamento and envelope control of oscillator pitch are implemented also add to the uniqueness of the Keys.Control via a MIDI keyboard is really a must as the touchpad on the Keys is not terribly easy to use polyphonically, despite being larger than on the other two Volcas. With an external controller the Keys responds to pitchbend and modulation. Also, many of the controls respond to MIDI control change (CC) messages, so they can be sequenced.The Volca Keys itself is a great instrument, its biggest selling point probably being its three-note polyphony at such a low cost. Yes, the limited oscillators, modulation abilities and envelope controls constrain the available palette of sounds and its paraphonic nature can limit playing style somewhat. But these are small prices to pay when there is such a small price to pay for the Korg in the first place, especially for an instrument with as much character as the Volca Keys.",

user to alter and animate sounds.Korg added to this a second break-through form of synthesis: wave
sequencing, by which short segments of sampled audio waveforms could be
played one after the other and cross-faded into each other for some
complex and unusual tones, pads, textures and rhythms. The Wavestation
had 2MB of ROM based samples at your disposal. Programming is not

It basically offers
Korg's acclaimed Ai2 sound engine (from the 01/w series) packed into a small,
lightweight, affordable package! Being an entry-level keyboard, the
usual luxuries such as aftertouch and an internal power supply have
been omitted, and it lacks an arpeggiator or a sequencer, however it
more than makes up for this in sound.In addition to its General MIDI sound set, the X5D comes loaded
with two banks of preset sounds that can be loaded alternately,
however you can overwrite the preset sounds and store up to one
hundred program sounds and one hundred combination sounds of your own.
The preset sounds vary widely, from complex pads and SFX sounds, to
pianos, organs and orchestral instruments. Some of these sound dated
in this day and age, the piano sound is a little on the thin side to
say the least, but the string, pad and organ sounds can still hold
their own against much newer keyboards! Korg have even included some
classic voices from their iconic M1
workstation. The famous 'Universe' and 'M1 Piano' sounds are
present in the X5D.Editing the sounds can at first be a bit like performing keyhole
surgery. The tiny two-line screen means that a lot of the words are
abbreviated, and a lot of scrolling and menu diving is required to
edit the sounds. However, it is a relatively short learning curve.
Once you have created some program sounds, you can combine up to eight
of them in combi mode. This allows you to create really thick sounds
and textures, but is also useful for creating keyboard splits and
velocity switched setups.The X5D is available in module form as the X5DR.",

Buchla,100 Series,11446,http://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/buchla100.php,2.97,4,n/a,n/a,0,1,0,0,0,{},"Buchla synthesizers are the classic creations of Don Buchla, a
circuit designer who produced synthesizers when they truly were analog
beasts. Buchla started making his first synthesizers on America's west
coast to facilitate the creation of electroacustic music, avoiding the
painstaking job of tape splicing of ""Musique Concrete"". (Musique Concrete
was a form of music creation pre-dating electronic music in which
recordings of various sounds on tape were cut, spliced, distorted, and
manipulated in various ways before being spliced back together into
something that could result in something musical.) 
This concept was the driving force behind
almost every Buchla synthesizer made - an electronic device that can
create some basic sound, manipulate it, tune it freely, and sequence it
into organized sound, hopefully something musical! With that in mind,
Buchla synthesizers were among the first to use indivudally tuneable
keys for limitless micro-tuning possibilities, analog sequencers, and
complex waveforms other than basic sine, sawtooth, and square waves.The first major synthesizer by Buchla was the modular 100-series (one of
which is pictured above) produced from about 1963 to the early 1970's.
The system usually consisted of a large wood case with room for a bunch
of modules (up to 25 modules on a single power-supply). Although the
modules consisted of your basic collection of voltage controlled
oscillators, filters, etc. the unique keyboards on this and other models
to follow were flat capacitance-sensitive touch-plates. Although they may feel
awkward to play, they are pressure sensitive and individually tuneable.
There were also 8- and 16-step analog sequencer modules available.
Patching and programming a Buchla 100 was a monstrous task since lots of
patch cords as well as synthesizer knowledge were a requirement to even
get a sound to be heard, and the oscillators usually drift out of tune!
These are extremely rare systems but they can make some awesome and
unique analog music, if it still works! About the only places where
Buchla 100's can be found nowadays are at the The Audities Collection and a few
scattered Schools and Universities across the US.Source: The A-Z of Analogue Synthesizers, by Peter Forrest, published by Susurreal

Buchla,200 Series,11726,http://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/buchla200.php,3.09,4,n/a,n/a,0,1,0,0,0,{},"THE ELECTRIC MUSIC BOXWhen Buchla started to expand itself into markets other than Schools and
Universities such as performing musicians and sound designers, they came
out with the far more advanced 200-series modules (1970-78). They dubbed
it, ""The Electric Music Box"". The 200's ability to interface its voltage
controlled analog circuitry with digital computers really opened the
door to complex programming and control not yet seen. They also
introduced a color-coded patch-cord system to simplify patching and to
provide an easy view of what's going where. It first came out as another
modular system encased in a large wood cabinet, as pictured above. The
flat touch-plate keyboard typically used by Buchla was also
found here.SYSTEM 101The System 101 (1970-78) was a very compact polyphonic synth using
modules from the 200-series. It was the smallest of the 200-series
""Electric Music Boxes"", designed for on-the-go musicians. The model
pictured above has a Model 212 Dodecamodule, Model 258
Dual Oscillator module, and Model 237 32-note standard
piano style keyboard in place of the Buchla-preferred touch-plate keys for a more musician-friendly experience.SILI-CON CELLOThe Sili-Con Cello is a very unique Buchla (circa 1978-79) consisting of
five 200 series modules plus a prototype A.I. binary counter module in
the upper left-hand corner. Encased in a 203-8 Portable case with a
model 214 power supply, the other modules include the 281
Quad Function Generator, the 292C Quad Lowpass Gate, the 266
Source of Uncertainty, the 259 Complex Wave Generator and the 270
Preamplifier. The Sili-Con was designed as an interactive synth to
respond to performance gestures from acoustic instruments. Using a
microphone connected through a preamp and envelope generator, control
voltages and gate signals could be generated from acoustic sounds and
used to control the synth. The unique binary counter module interprets
the CV and gate signals and 'plays' the synth by instructing it to
generate musical sounds. The name comes from the fact that it was made
for a cellist (Ami Radunskaya) to use in a piece called ""Sili-Con
Cello"".* Photo from The Audities Foundation.MUSIC EASELThe Music Easel, released in 1972/73, is a very rare compact Buchla synth
that had the Model 208 Stored Program Sound Source module
inside of a Model 203-8 briefcase-style metal case. It also used the
Model 218 pressure-sensitive touch-plate keyboard
(with 32 keys). As small as it was it managed to include a 5-stage
sequencer, 22 sliders, and over 25 color-coded patch-points. The Music
Easel was housed in an aluminum case that closed up like a brief-case
for travel purposes with room for its patch cords and memory cards. It
is quite similar to the EMS Synthi AKS, but
likely more flexible, programmable and even more rare.The Music Easel also featured a relative breakthrough for its time:
Patch storage! But it was rudimentary storage - resistors installed to
""program"" cards were used. You needed one card full of resistors for
each patch and they had to be manually plugged in to be used. They
stored slider, switch and knob positions as well as patch-point
connections. To be used they had to be inserted into a slot, one at a
time, on the upper left side of the synth. They can also be seen in the
picture above in their own storage compartment directly above the patch
cord storage compartment. The Music Easel originally sold with six blank
cards and some resistors and instructions. There was even a
re-chargeable battery pack for added portability (up to 3 hours).Source: The A-Z of Analogue Synthesizers, by Peter Forrest, published by Susurreal

It is still
an analog synthesizer, but with some 21st century improvements, most
notably the addition of MIDI control, patch memory storage and digital
hybridization. Other improvements include internal MIDI buses, more
voltage controlled parameters, a router for signals and control
voltages, velocity sensitivity, and a redesigned output section of the
complex oscillator module. A few new modules have also been added
including a duophonic pitch class generator and a triple morphing
filter.The 200e may be new but it is still a classic modular system. That
means potential customers must start with an empty cabinet, and select
the synthesis modules from the 200e series to design the system to their
personal needs. It is even possible to add some of the original classic
200 series modules to  it, and to add the new 200e series modules to an
original 200 system. With five cabinet sizes to choose from (from 2
panels to 18 panels), no two systems may look alike, and they can range
from just a module or two to the complex analog beast pictured
above.The 200e series is not exactly analog either (nor digital). The 200e
series is truly an analog-digital hybrid modular system with an analog
user-interface but a state-of-the art underlying electronic system
designed to provide stable, dynamic musical sounds with exceptional
sonic quality. Buchla's engineers sought the best possible designs for
their modules which meant that in some cases the signal path may be
truly analog, while in other cases they may in fact be digital. Almost
all analog signals are also controlled by digital componentry for
maintaining stability or to enable patch storage, for example. Speaking
of patch storage, the 200e will only store knob settings and switch
position but not patch cable routings.As awesome as having modern day Buchla 200 analog systems available
for purchase is, they are still very hard to come by. New systems must
be ordered directly from Buchla and they are expensive! A complete
system could cost anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000! Individual modules
cost on average about $1,000. The price tag, learning curve and really
old-school nature will certainly put this system out of the realm of the
casual musician. Yet, with the demise of so many classic synth makes
(ARP, EML, EMS), and the abandonment of their analog-modular heritage by
so many existing makes (Roland, Moog, E-mu) it is truly exciting to see
one of the original pioneers, Don Buchla, using today's technology to
continue making yesterday's synthesizers.",

simplified panel layout, encased in a solid wood cabinet. Although based
on the designs of it's predecessors (the 100 and 200
series modules), gone are the patch cords and confusion of a modular
system. As was introduced in the 200-Series as well as the Touche, the Buchla 400 continued the use
of a digital computer processor to control the programming of its
digital oscillators, analog filters, amplifiers, modulation sources and
more with unprecedented control and depth.The 400 featured six voices with digital oscillators that offered FM
synthesis, waveshape interpolation, timbre modulation and more. It used
the pressure-sensitive touch-plate style keyboard; awkward
to play, but unique with individual key tuning and pressure-sensitive
joysticks. The 400 also featured a lot of Control Voltage and Gate
inputs/outputs for interfacing with other 100 or 200 series Buchla
modules and synthesizers.Programming had to be accomplished by hooking up a computer monitor to
it for access to its graphic editing and sequencing functions. It
offered sophisticated computer control of up to 64 acoustic parameters
using a music programming language called ""MIDAS"". It also featured a
real-time ""score"" editor with SMPTE locking, which was
really a preview of what would become modern day computer-based MIDI
sequencing. Complete scores including any and all patches used can be
stored onto cassette tape or program cards, and later recalled. The
score could also be manipulated in sophisticated ways in real-time while
playing or recording.Buchla 406The 406 prototype pictured above is basically the 400 with a standard
piano-style keyboard with 61 keys. All pressure-sensitive touch surfaces

three sets of MIDI inputs/outputs, as well as CV/Gate, SMPTE, and two
RS232 ports. It continued Buchla's tradition of advanced computer
control of its analog circuitry. And the pressure- and
position-sensitive touch-plate concept was implemented to
the max on the 700; the keyboard and almost every other control surface
is a touch-plate!The Buchla 700 was leaps ahead of previous Buchla synths, it could now
control up to 190 acoustic variables. The 700 had 12 voices with 4
digital oscillators per voice (48 oscillators!), capable of a wide range
of sonic creation including FM, waveshape interpolation and timbre
modulation. Filters, modifiers and amps are all still in the analog
domain. There can be up to 6 modifiers per voice, 15 envelopes per voice
and the envelopes can have up to 96 break-points!!!A large centralized futuristic LCD display shows you what you're editing

external monitor hook-up is required). It used ""MIDAS VII"" a music

3-oscillators per voice for a total of 24 oscillators! It had a normal
61-note keyboard with split/layering capabilities unlike the quirky touch-plate keys found on other Buchla
synths. This was a Buchla designed for performing musicians.The computer used to program the Touché utilized a proprietary
computer language called FOIL (Far Out Instrument Language). Data entry
into the Touché was done via the front panel, but an external
monitor must be connected to see what you are doing. The 24 oscillators
of the Touché are also digital for a very stable and wide range

Hammond worked with Ace Electronics to create several rhythm machines meant to work in tandem with their organs, so it is no coincidence the sounds are very similar. There are sixteen preset rhythms, with four variations each, for the 64 namesake beat patterns. The large case was meant to sit on top of the home spinet organs of the ‘60s and ‘70s, and there is even a Plexiglas panel on the top of the 64 to act as a sheet music stand when it is sitting on top of the organ.On the rear of the machine are the standard connections (for the time), which is to say a power plug, an audio out jack, a balance trim pot to balance the high and low frequency of the audio output, and a foot switch for starting and stopping the patterns. While it lacked some individual volume controls for kick, snare, cymbals and such, found on the Roland TR-77, it does give you more combo possibilities than just the sixteen rhythms, because (just like the TR-77) you can press two or more buttons together to build combo patterns. Each of the sixteen rhythm selections contains four variations-- A, B, C, and D-- and are two measures long.These four variations lead to the Auto-Vari switch, which is the dynamic heart of this machine. With the Auto-Vari function engaged, the four pattern variations, per selected rhythm(s), will cycle based on the measure dial control knob. At the shortest setting of 1/2 Measure, it will play the first half of the first bar of A, the second half of the first bar of B, the first half of the second bar of C and the second half of the second bar of D. At the 1 Measure setting, it will play one measure per variation before advancing and so on. Panel indicator lights show the user variation and measure information. The rest of the panel buttons are simple one- function affairs-- Off/Tempo, Start/Stop, Rhythm Pattern Selectors, and Volume.While it is playing back a pattern, everything is live so you do not have to stop to change your settings. Playing the machine on the fly, changing the tempo, pattern selections and variations can give you some fun results.  Turn off the Auto-Vari function and you can create manual patterns of your own by selecting variations in the order you choose.Not to mention all these old machines sound great through delays, distortion, reverb, compression or any effect pedals you may have laying around.  And they're a lot cheaper to find than their more famous siblings.",

Pearlman, an
electronics engineer inspired by what the Moog synthesizer was doing, particularly
after hearing the now famous Wendy Carlos album, “Switched on Bach”. In
1970, ARP introduced its first modular synthesizer, the model 2500. As
with almost everything ARP did during its existence, the 2500 was
designed in direct competition with the Moog synthesizers that were
garnering most of the attention at the time.The 2500 is a technologically advanced synthesizer following the traditional modular
format. There are 15 modules covering all the bases: VCOs, filters,
envelope generators, modulators, sample and hold circuits, even a
sequencer. The Studio wood cabinet had space for 15 modules, and
smaller 8-space Wing cabinets allowed for expanded or
portable systems. Like all modular systems of the day, buyers got to
custom order their system with any combination of modules, cabinets and
keyboard options. This means that existing 2500 systems today could come
in any number of possible configurations, from compact portable systems
to over-blown multi-cabinet multi-keyboard behemoths.Unlike other modular synthesizers, the 2500 does not use patch
cables to route the signal between its modules. It uses a unique 10x10
matrix switch system to accomplish signal routings. Modules are located
in the center row of the cabinet, with the matrix switches located above
and below the modules. Module inputs and outputs are represented by
vertical switches, and the horizontal busses represent a patch cord.
Color-coded pins are positioned horizontally along the matrix to make
connections. This matrix system allows for a very flexible and
customized signal flow without the mess of patch cables. The only
downsides are the potential for crosstalk between the busses, and it may
seem less obvious at a glance just exactly what is being patched into
what than with traditional patch systems.The 2500's modules themselves are also a bit overwhelming. The 2500 allows you to create plenty of
excellent sounds with its great filters and many other excellent circuits and
parameters. However, it is clear that these modules were designed by an engineer
and not a musician. The modules are covered in electronic diagrams and offer
a ton of controls. The high learning curve the 2500 presents made it a popular
addition to the music departments of universities. But it was the easier to navigate ARP 2600
that would provide a much more musician-friendly experience and would prove to become
ARP's most popular synthesizer.Nevertheless, a 2500 is a prized piece of kit for any studio. The
2500s are known to have superior oscillators to the Moog, offering
reliable and stable tuning that does not drift. These may not be for the
faint of heart, but the results of creating your own sounds on them will
be very rewarding. Since only about 100 were sold (give or take), they are also
very rare. It has been used by Meat Beat Manifesto, Pete Townshend,
Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis, Jimmy Edgar, Vince Clarke, Roger Powell (Cosmic Furnace), 
David Hentschel (w/ Elton John & Peter Hammil), Joe Renzetti and Tony Luisi (Electric Tommy),
Hugo Montenegro, Patrick Gleeson (w/ Jon Mark), Joop Stokkerman, Faust, Eliane Radigue, filmcomposer
Jerry Goldsmith on 'Logan's Run', and communicating with the aliens
in Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
Original list prices for modules ranged from $400 to $1,200 with
complete systems going for $8,000 to $20,000. Adjusted for inflation,
that would be something like $45,000 to $110,000 today!!!",

This unique semi-modular monophonic synthesizer was designed for professionals but was also user-friendly enough to be used as a teaching instrument. The 2600, in fact ARP as a whole, competed directly against the synthesizer systems coming from Moog throughout the 1970's. The 2600 was ARP's answer to the modular system, creating a more compact, more stable and more intuitive synthesizer. While most modular systems of the time were custom ordered and built to the buyer's specification, that flexibility often came at a high cost, both on the wallet and the brain. Instead of picking and choosing from a catalog of individual modules that you (or the manufacturer) then had to mount inside a case and wire together, the 2600 is a semi-modular system with a fixed selection of basic synth modules internally pre-wired and ready to go! Most of these connections can be ""re-wired"" with patch-cords at clearly labeled patch-points. This made the 2600 more user-friendly, portable and easier to create sounds with!The 2600 is an analog beast capable of producing some amazing sounds. Its basic architecture consists of a totally analog signal path with three oscillators, one 24 dB/oct filter, one ADSR envelope, one VCA and one mixer section. Additional features include an envelope follower, ring modulator, noise generator, LFO with sample and hold, built-in spring reverb and a pre-amplifier with stereo speakers. Truly a model of analog subtractive synthesis, the 2600 has plenty of switches and sliders to satisfy all your creative sonic needs. If you have a keen understanding of how the different synth modules operate, with some creative patching and routing you can construct some truly expressive and musical analog sounds. Or you can forego patching the signal and rely entirely on the 2600's standard internal pre-wiring which routes the signal through a traditional synthesizer signal path.Produced from 1971 to 1980, the 2600 has undergone several revisions comprising four model generations. They are all a little bit different, some with changes due to reliability issues, some due to legal issues, and some for cosmetic reasons. It's accepted that while the 2600s became more reliable and serviceable as their production progressed, they also got worse in the sound quality department, especially among models made after 1972. They're still great, but relative to the early models, they just got less great sounding. Naturally, the best sounding models are the oldest and rarest. What follows is a break-down of the 2600 series. Much of the following info can also be found at CMS Discrete Synthesizers.Model 2600:The Model 2600 was produced in early 1971 and is known as the ""Blue Marvin"". It has mistakenly been called the ""Blue Meanie"" but according to Alan R. Pearlman, the ""Blue Marvin"" is so named after Marvin Cohen, ARP's CFO at the time. It came in a bright blue aluminum case with a funky and fragile wood and metal enclosure. It used an entirely micro-chip based voice path but the chips wound up being highly unreliable, although they sounded great! Only a few of these were made (approx. 25) and most of them were built in a garage.ARP 2600 Blue MarvinModel 2600C:The 2600C was produced mid-1971 under proper factory conditions. The blue face plate was replaced by a gray face, leading to this model's nick name of ""Gray Meanie"". The wooden and metal enclosure of the previous model was retained, but a slightly updated keyboard (model 3604C) was added. About 35 of these were made.ARP 2600C Gray MeanieModel 2600P:2600P v1.0: Later in 1971 came the 2600P v1.0 which featured the same metal case (and the same electronics as the original models) now housed in a much more roadworthy suitcase-style enclosure.2600P v2.0: As mentioned before, the chips used thus far, though they sounded great, had reliability issues. ARP addressed this with the 2600P v2.0 around 1972. The most significant change was the switch from the Teledyne brand 4011/4017 VCO chips to the 4027 from National Semiconductor.2600P v3.0: After a short run of the v2.0, a few more internal changes led to the 2600P v3.0 which switched to the 4027-1 VCO. These new VCO chips were noisy and did not sound as good as the previous chips. The rectangular Tonus ARP logo was replaced by a new G-clef ARP logo which is often used to distinguish these newer 2600's from the previous models version of the 2600P. Also, the front panel was made a little taller, providing some extra room along the very top and bottom of the front panel. The 2600P v3.0 was produced from 1972 to 74 and is the most common model.2600P v4.0: A new duo-phonic keyboard (Model 3620) with LFO was introduced with the 2600P v4.0 in 1974. It also has the new G-clef ARP logo.ARP 2600P v2.0Unfortunately, further changes to inferior parts were just around the corner. The Model 4012 filter used in all the 2600s through 1976 utilized a design that was a copy of Moog's patented ladder-filter design. This led to a legal dispute between Moog and ARP which forced ARP, under the threat of legal action, to design a new filter. This resulted in the Model 4072 filter, a four-pole low-pass VCF which, unfortunately, is widely considered to be faulty due to a design error. The frequency response of the 4072 filter only goes to about 12kHz giving it a duller and weaker sound than the previous Moog style 4012 filter. This issue was not exclusive to the 2600, but also plagued some of ARP's other products including the Odyssey.Model 2601:2601 v1.0: The first 2601 models looked nearly identical to the last 2600P models. The major differences were improved jacks and slider controls and smaller trim holes. They were also still using the disputed 4012 filters during their production run from 1975-76.2601 v2.0: In 1977 ARP started using their new 4072 filter in the model 2601 v2.0 which also featured the bold new orange-on-black design. These were produced from 1977 through 1980.2601 v3.0: Late in 1980, a final revision was released with un-potted submodules, making them easier to maintain, and a revised suitcase. However these late models are quite rare as their release coincided with ARP's final days.ARP 2601 v2.0There were three versions of the remote keyboard associated with the 2600. The Model 3601 is a very rudimentary version with just Portamento and Tuning controls. The Model 3604 is similar but adds adjustable scaling and was used until 1974. The duo-phonic Model 3620 (pictured) which adds a dedicated LFO, latching and some other very useful features was introduced with the 2600P v4.0 and was used with all subsequent models from 1974 to 1980.ARP 3620 KeyboardCharting the History of 2600 ModelsIn its ten year run, no more than an estimated 3,000 units were produced. With those numbers, the 2600 can be considered somewhat rare, although its impact on music has been anything but rare! Famous 2600 users include Orbital, Underworld, 808 State, Meat Beat Manifesto, Hardfloor, Jean Michel Jarre, BT, Joy Division, Depeche Mode, Weather Report, Rebirth, Xpando, Add N To (X), Chemical Brothers, Front Line Assembly, David Holmes, Tony Banks, Rick Wakeman, Pete Townshend, Roger Joseph Manning Jr., Patrick Moraz, Matthew Sweet, the Crystal Method, Stevie Wonder, Vince Clarke, Freddy Fresh, Nine Inch Nails, and Edgar Winter. It was even used at Skywalker Sound to create the vocalizations for R2D2!The 2600 has had a lasting popularity that has led to its modern rebirth in the form of some excellent computer software synth emulations.

rise to the Avatar, which in turn, was such a dud it practically sank
the whole company before ARP finally sold off it's last and would-be
greatest project - the Chroma - to
CBS Musical Instruments. The Avatar was too expesnive for its own good
($3,000). It did seem to work, however; you use a hex pickup for your
guitar which allows the guitar to play the synth sounds. Today the
Avatar is used more like an expander module with
other ARP and CV/Gate type synthesizers.It has two oscillators and is very much like the ARP Odyssey in terms of its sounds, programming and
interface. Many of the features that make the Odyssey great (oscillator
sync, ring modulator, sample and hold, portamento, envelope follower and
more) can be found on the Avatar. The Avatar makes a great and more
affordable way to get Odyssey sounds. Use it to fatten up you're current
Odyssey or incorporate it into you're synth studio as an analog synth

Avatar makes a great alternative buy to the Odyssey since it is capable
of all the same sounds that the Odyssey has provided for these artists

It was very
similar to ARP's Pro-Soloist and Pro-DGX preset synths, but offered
more flexibility when it came to modifying or creating entirely new sounds.
The preset sounds of the Explorer are your basic flute, trumpet, clarinet,
strings, pulsar, lunar lander, etc. But unlike other preset synths
of the time, in ""Manual"" mode you could synthesize all kinds of new sounds
ranging from wind effects to electronic synth sounds.The simple design and controls offer three main sections. The waveform section
lets you mix and match its  various waveforms at different pitch ranges to create
unique sounds and timbres. There's a VCF/VCA section with basic ADSR and filter
controls for shaping and contouring sounds. The filter is a decent low-pass 4-pole
filter. And an effects section offers controls for repeat, vibrato, pitch bend, portamento, etc.
All in all the Explorer is a unique and somewhat rare piece of equipment which signalled,
at least for ARP, the transition of compact vintage synths from preset to programmable sounds.

runaway success as the first compact studio synthesizer, ARP responded
with a compact and user-friendly studio synthesizer of their own with
the Odyssey in 1972. An almost equally legendary machine itself, the
Odyssey was ARP's highest selling synth back then, and still is to
this day in the second-hand market.The Odyssey essentially gives you a simplified hard-wired ARP 2600 in a much smaller and affordable package. The
Odyssey is a 2-oscillator analog synth (with duo-phonic capability)
and it sounds really nice; the Minimoog has three oscillators and is
capable of thicker sounds. The Odyssey comes well equipped with all
the tweakable features and analog goodness you'd expect: a resonant
low pass filter, ADSR envelopes, sine or square wave LFO, and a
sample-and-hold function.The Odyssey also added a few new features such as a high pass
filter that could be used in series with the low pass,
oscillator-sync capability, and pulse-width modulation. It is a very
professional and expressive machine that can create nice analog
basses, interesting leads, great effects and sweeping sounds straight
out of a Tangerine Dream album!There were many versions of the Odyssey over the years, each a
little different. They can be broken down into 8 models spanning
3 Mark ""Mk"" versions:Odyssey Mk I (Model 2800)First came the Odyssey Mk I (Model 2800) produced between 1972-75.
These used a smooth but tinny sounding 2-pole voltage-controlled filter design
(model 4023) similar to those used in the Oberheim SEM modules. From 1972 to 74 the Odyssey
was produced with a white-faced front panel with black lettering.
During 1974 to 75 they switched to a redesigned black front panel with
gold lettering. However, all Mk I's can be identified by the rotary
knob they use for pitch bending. None had any interface jacks, but a
factory modification was available to add interface jacks as well as a
PPC pitch bender in place of the rotary knob.

2Odyssey Mk II (Model 2813)Image from ANALOG, U.S., INC.'s Ebay store.Odyssey Mk II (Models 2810-2815)Then the Odyssey Mk II series came along, featuring 5 models
(2810-2815) which were produced between 1975 to 78. Visually, they
continued with the black and gold color-scheme seen on the late Mk
I's. But under the hood, the Mk II series had several improvements.
The VCO design was improved for better tracking. The power supply was
improved. The sample+hold memory was improved. The keyboard current
source was improved allowing for CV and Gate control to be added.
The rotary pitch bend knob was also replaced by ARP's
own PPC (Proportional Pitch Controller) - three pressure sensitive
buttons, either by factory modification kit on earlier models, or from
the factory on later models.But the biggest change in the Mk II was in its filter. Early
versions of the 2810 model still had the 2-pole model 4023 filter used
in the Mk I but were soon replaced with a beefier 4-pole VCF
(model 4035). This filter used a ladder design that was very similar
to the Moog filter. While rumors persist that Moog sued ARP over this,
no suit ever occurred. Arp and Moog came to an amicable agreement and
a small licensing fee was paid by ARP for units previously
manufactured. ARP soon after designed a new 4-pole, low pass
filter - the model 4075 filter - which was used in all subsequent
Odyssey models. Unfortunately, while the new model 4075 version of the
filter was still beefy at low frequencies and very stable, it also had
a well known bandwidth limit error around 12 to 14 kHz, resulting in a
weak sound at high resonance or when driven into self-oscillation.
This has made the rarer black and gold 2810 Odysseys with the model 4035
Moog-like ladder filter the more sought after and pricier models.

set to match the look of the latest ARP synths with the orange and

synths.  It's a four-section synthesizer consisting of a Bass synth,
Poly synth, Lead synth, and String synth. It is quite good at emulating
each of these sounds and can function in any of its four modes at a time
with the ability of layering the different sections! Sounds you create
in any of the four sections are instantly recalled from memory by the
push of a button! There are 16 program patches for storing your sounds.
Other major features are the incredible phase shifter, tons of balanced
audio outputs for each section, dual portamento controls and a superior
arpeggiator...that's pretty good for 1978! On the downside, it has a
fragile mylar front panel, very limited programability and a weird
feature that autotunes the keys to play weird intervals.The Bass synth section is monophonic and can be programmed to occupy the
lower two octaves of the Quadra's 5-octave 61-note keyboard. The bass
sounds pretty good and has 16' and 8' presets each for Electric and
String Bass sections.The string section is based on the Omni II
String synth. It sounds excellent and implements a phase-shift effect
that is sort-of like a chorusing effect that thickens its already great
string sound. In Polyphonic synth mode there are more effects available
such as sample-n-hold and the phase-shifter. String and Poly Synth
sections have 8' and 4' Polyphonic Waveform Generators each along with a
preset called Hollow Waveform.In Lead synth mode the Quadra becomes a two voice screamer with
aftertouch sensitivity in the upper octaves of the keyboard! It's
duophonic (like the Odyssey). Get a bass sequence going, switch over to
another section and play along! The Quadra is a synthesizer well suited
to live performance use and has been used by 808 State, ELO,

In fact, it is the Orchestra! ARP bought, relabeled
and sold it as the Quartet without changing it much. It's a 4-part
orchestral synthesizer with 4 sections: Brass, Strings, Organ and Piano.
These 4 tone color families can be played individually or two can be
simultaneously played. They are also individually tweakable. Selected
presets will light up LEDs to show you which sliders and buttons can be
used to modify the current section. The synth itself is very limited
however, and there's no external control, no pitch/mod wheel and few
edit parameters. But it sounds very good and it is, after all, a classic
analog synth.The Brass section creates Trumpet and Trombone sounds with independent
attack and sustain controls. The String section creates Cello and Violin
sounds with independent attack and sustain controls. The Organ section
is 2-voice and has a Celeste sound available as well. The Piano section
offers two types, traditional or Honky Tonk. The Quartet has been used
by 808 State and Massive Attack for some those great string

This is not a synthesizer, it was (for
its time) a  sophisticated 16-step sequencer used to control other
synths. You create your sequences with  the sliders. Adjust the sliders
to change pitch while each slider represents a sixteenth note, for
example, in the 1 bar pattern it loops. It uses the ancient Control
Voltage (CV) and Gate protocols to play your sequences on another analog
synthesizer. Because of the various types of CV/Gate used by different
makers at the time, the ARP Sequencer works perfectly with the ARP 2500, 2600, Odyssey, Avatar and
other ARP synthesizers as well as Roland, Oberheim and Sequential
Circuits. To interface the Sequencer with other types of CV/Gate capable
synths would require a CV converter box.Once you get it working it's fun and easy to learn. Use it to create
continuous arpeggios or simple sequences of patterns for your vintage
analog gear. Tweak it in real-time as you create or perform, it's very
hands-on. It has a classic and recognizable character as you can hear in
the demo below. Famous users include The Who, Depeche Mode, 808

late 1970's disco era. It's a multi-orchestral machine with Violin, Viola,
Trumpet, Horn, Cello and Contra-Bass sounds. These sounds can be engaged via
individual on/off switches, allowing for a variety of ensemble configurations.
The Cello and Contra-Bass sounds are monophonic and available only on the
lower 20 keys of the keyboard. The remaining four sounds are polyphonic and
can be played across the entire length of the keyboard. On their own, the
sounds are quite unrealistic and not particularly useable. But when combined
as an ensemble, and especially with the Chorus effect engaged, the resulting
string sound becomes especially lush and shimmery.The Solina String Ensemble uses divide-down technology, common in organs of
the era, to achieve full polyphony. The Chorus/Ensemble effect is achieved by
passing the sound through three modulated delay lines that cause a
phase-shifting effect to make it sound thicker and more animated. There are
also on-board Crescendo (attack) and Sustain Length (decay) sliders, volume
sliders and a global tuning knob. It also has Gate and Trigger
outputs from the polyphonic keyboard and is completely cased in wood (or
wood-like) panels with a clean and discrete layout.The Solina String Ensemble, like a few other ARP products, is not actually
an ARP invention. The Solina was created by the Dutch company Eminent in 1974.
It was derived from the string section of Eminent's 310U Organ, and sold
commercially as the Eminent Solina String Ensemble. ARP bought the rights to
re-brand the Solina for the US market as the ARP String Ensemble. There were
also four versions: SE-I was monoaural with a permanent chorus effect, SE-II
added an on/off switch for the chorus effect, SE-III added stereo sound, and
SE-IV added LEDs.The String Ensemble has been used by Air, The Eagles, Elton John, Pink
Floyd, The Cure, Joy Division, OMD, Josh Wink, STYX, Tangerine Dream, Keane,
Japan, and New Order.",

circuitry and has a lot of hands-on knobs for instant sound tweaking.
And while the 777 has extensive editing and modulation abilities, the
layout is as basic and intuitive as an old SH-101 or MC-202!The 777 functions quite well as either a standalone bass sequencer or as
a sound module in a MIDI environment. Two oscillators (A / B) produce a
fat bass sound. Modulation abilities are quite complex, the oscillators
themselves can modulate each other for example. The filter is very nice
with switchable 3 or 7 pole slopes as well as other sound shaping
controls for a wide range of tones. An external sound can be routed
through the filter too. The sequencer, OSC B and the decay envelope can
also modulate the filter cutoff. The 777 also employs a smart accent
effect for that extra bit o' kick in your bassline.As a sequencer the 777 shines once again. Bear in mind that this
sequencer accommodates a monophonic (single tone) instrument which
normally has very basic sequencing needs. Notes are entered using the
pseudo-keyboard buttons. Programming is different than other synth /
grooveboxes of similar function but is relatively easy to master. Up to
256 patterns can be linked to form up to 16 songs all of which remain in
memory. And of course all real-time editing can be recorded into your
sequence and are also MIDI controllable. Final goodies include an
internal MIDI to CV-gate converter, glide or portamento effects,
distortion, chorus and phase effects and more!

outside the box! The Revolution looks amazing and will pique anybody's
curiosity because it doesn't look like anything we've seen before -
certainly not a musical instrument! Future Retro have designed it to
better coincide with the circular or cyclic nature of time and music
which they feel makes it a more natural, if not unique, means of music creation. Like all Future Retro products we've reviewed thus far, it is a
monophonic TB-style analog synthesizer tied to a step-based pattern and
song based sequencer, designed for the techno, trance, acid, and
electro-blip-beep-bop musicians. There are also on-board analog and DSP
effects processing, and various interfacing options for controlling MIDI,
CV/Gate, and Din Sync devices.First, the synthesizer: The Revolution uses true analog synthesis
throughout its entire sound engine. Only the DSP effects are digital.
Future Retro wants you to know that this is as faithful a replication of
the TB-303 sound as they can get using todays top quality circuitry. It's
oscillator provides the exact same waveforms as the TB (square/saw)
but under much more stable and purer circumstances. Even the quirky
3-pole (18 dB/oct) filter, gated amplifier, accent and glide circuits of
the TB-303 are all replicated. And all the original knob/controls of the
TB-303 are represented, as well as a new CV Modulation amount control
which allows the filter's cutoff frequency to track either internal or
external control voltages. There is also an Accent Decay time control
for tweaking the attack of the Accent effect which can create some funky
zap and zoom accents.The Sequencer: Future Retro have taken the TB's linear sequencer and
gone circular with it. Play a pattern and you'll see the first benefit
of this new design as LEDs run around in a circular loop, each LED representing
1-step of the pattern, giving more natural visual cues as to the
playback and timing of your patterns. Some may find this instantly
exciting and better than the old linear style. There is memory for 256
Patterns to be stored. Each pattern records note duration, pitch,
accent, glide, loop point, time signature, and swing amount. Pattern
editing features include copy/paste, pattern shifting, pattern
transposing, multiple pattern cueing for chaining patterns together
live, and LED chase. The Revolution also provides the ability to play
patterns forwards or backwards, and remotely select patterns to play
using MIDI program change messages. There are 16 songs to arrange the
patterns in. In addition, the Revolution provides a unique Remix feature
which provides 256 variations for every pattern and song, for more than
65,000 possible patterns right out of the box!!!Effects and Interfaces: It has analog and digital effects. The analog
effect is an Overdrive. The digital effects include 24 bit stereo
chorus, delay, flange, reverb, leslie, etc. Round back are MIDI
connections for syncing playback with external sequencers, playing MIDI
sound modules, or having external sequencers or MIDI keyboard
controllers play the Revolution's analog section. Din Sync out is
included for syncing up the playback of the early Roland TR and TB type
devices to todays MIDI sequencers. Also provided are CV and Gate outputs
for playing other analog equipment using the Revolution's sequencer, or
using the Revolution as a MIDI to CV converter. And there's also the CV Mod 
input mention earlier.The original Revolution models had a white chassis while the second
generation R2 have a gun metal gray chassis. The R2 has
an updated PC board design using a new RAM chip which extends the
internal back up battery life to more than 10 years and they include OS version 2.0.Designed for Acid, and I'm sure it also looks awesome on acid...
it's one tricked out machine for creating everything

more aggressive ripping overdriven lead sounds. It's the state-of-the-art TB-emulator

there are 7 inputs and 11 outputs that can be utilized to override the
pre-wired signal routings and interface with other instruments - even
process external audio - making the XS a true semi-modular

modulated independently by internal and external signals for complex
waveforms. A dedicated LFO can be used to modulate external or
internal signals. The 2-pole multimode filter can be used as a
lowpass, bandpass, highpass, or notch filter and is capable of
self-oscillation. Velocity-sensitive ADSR envelopes can be used to
alter filter and amp.Both MIDI and CV/Gate can be used separately or together to control
signals in a variety of configurations. It can also act as a CV/Gate
to MIDI converter, including CV/Gate/Mod Wheel/Velocity signals for
controlling other analog instruments.The XS can be used to make a variety of analog synth sounds
including basslines, leads, drones, percussion, and sound effects.
Although the XS is monophonic, multiple units can be linked together
for more flexible and polyphonic possibilities. And like any true
analog synth, there is no on-board memory, no effects processors, and
sequencing/arpeggiation features are handled via external controllers
(such as Future Retro's Revolution).",

classic Moog, Arp, E-mu, Buchla, Serge, and Roland modular synthesizers
of the sixties and seventies, the A-100 system is a true analog system,
yet it's only been in production since 1995. It features analog
subtractive, additive, FM, wavetable sequencing, and vector synthesis
methods. Pictured above is a behemoth system, actually four cases full
of modules plus 3 MAQ16/3 sequencers, 3 MS-404's and a Shaltwerk sequencer...all linked
into one massive analog beast!Just above is a more typical A-100 system. Like the vintage modulars,
the A-100 system is usually a custom built system. Doepfer offers
several function specific modules that you can pick and choose from to
fill up and design your system. There are modules for its oscillators,
filters, amplifiers, LFOs, sequencers, frequency shifters, effects, and
so on (see tech specs below). The true specifications of your A-100 is
really only limited by the number and variety of modules you choose. The
A-100 system consists of more than 65 different modules (as of May 2001)
but the system will be extended in the future. Some of these modules are
unique and do not exist in any other synths. Of course, there are also
A-100 Basic systems (ready-made) for those of you looking for a powerful
synthesizer but don't know a lot about the selecting appropriate
modules and designing a modular system (pictured below).Like its classic predecessors, it has absolutely no patch memory
storage...how could it? Like any real modular synth, it is
patchable. That means that you have to patch your sounds by hand,
linking the osc. to the filters, amps, LFOs, etc. manually. Only then
can you start twisting the knobs and shaping sounds. This requires a
deep understanding of analog synthesis (or a serious desire to learn it)
in order to get the most out of your modular system. But unlike the
modulars of yesterday, the A-100 has MIDI control, so it's perfectly
suited for any studio work without any hassles. For hobbyists,
programmers, and experimental musicians, the A-100 is the perfect
choice. for jumping into analog modular synthesis! It has been used by

module produced by Doepfer
Musikelektronik. At the time of the Dark Energy's launch in 2009,
Doepfer was perhaps best known as a manufacturer of Eurorack modular
systems. The Dark Energy owes its existence directly to Doepfer's
modular products, it is the A-111-5 Synthesizer
Voice module in a rugged, fully-enclosed metal housing. Whereas
the A-111-5 has the usual silver finish of Doepfer modules, the Dark
Energy's case is an attractive black finish with retro-style black
knobs, toggle switches and wooden end panels.The Dark Energy is a single oscillator synth capable of producing
square/pulse, triangle or sawtooth waveforms. The square/pulse wave can
be used on its own or in conjunction with the triangle or sawtooth
waveforms. The triangle and sawtooth waveforms can also be used
individually, but it's not possible to use triangle and sawtooth
together.The Dark Energy has two LFOs, both capable of triangle or square waves.
Each LFO has a range switch for low, medium or high frequency ranges,
allowing for very slow modulation, through traditional LFO settings,
right up into the audio range (to about 5 kHz) allowing for audio-rate
frequency modulation. The synth's single ADSR envelope generator also
has a range switch, so the envelope can vary from very short and snappy
to very long and slowly evolving.The VCO frequency can be modulated either by LFO1 or the envelope,
whilst the continuously variable pulse-width can be modulated by LFO2 or
the envelope. With the LFOs set in the audio range, interesting FM
sounds can be achieved, but unfortunately the LFO frequency cannot track
the keyboard. The VCA level can be increased so that drones can be
produced, or it can be controlled by the envelope or LFO1, again with
filter FM capabilities with the LFO on the high setting.The filter is a 24 dB/octave Curtis filter with VCO tracking, which can
be set to off, half or full tracking. The filter resonance can be turned
up such that the filter self-oscillates, allowing a sine-wave sound to
be blended in with the other waveforms. The tracking is not as precise
as the VCO and it is not temperature compensated, but the sine tracks
pretty well over a couple of octaves without adjustment.The filter cut-off can be controlled either by the envelope or LFO2, the
level control being labelled XFM for exponential frequency modulation.
The control labelled LFM provides linear audio-rate frequency modulation
of the VCF by the triangle waveform of the VCO allowing for other rich
sounds.Portamento is a cheap, optional extra for DIY fitting, although some
retailers sold the unit with the option ready fitted. Unfortunately, the
positioning of the glide knob on the front vertical panel means that the
unit has to be laid flat.The Dark Energy is a very capable little synth, able to produce fairly
complex sounds that belie its single oscillator nature and delivering
quite a punch in a very small package. It can produce beefy bass-lines,
classic-sounding leads or more aggressive ones, plus interesting, gritty
FM-based effects and noises.And there the story might end, were it not for the patch points that
adorn the bottom of the top panel and the back panel. These 1/8 inch
sockets allow the Dark Energy to interface with other equipment via
1V/octave control voltages. Consequently, the Dark Energy has been
described as a ""gateway drug"" into the world of modular
synthesis!The Dark Energy can be controlled via traditional DIN MIDI input, or via
USB MIDI, the latter being the only digital component in the machine.
Between the USB connection and the CV patch-points, the Dark Energy
effectively can be used as a MIDI-to-CV interface, another little trick
up its sleeve.The patch-points on the rear deliver CVs controlled by incoming MIDI
messages, such as pitch-bend, velocity or control changes. The front
panel patch-points comprise outputs for audio and envelope and LFO1 CVs
and inputs for external audio and CVs for gate, VCO frequency and
pulse-width, VCF frequency and VCA amplitude.Dark Energy IIThe lack of availability of the Curtis CEM3394
complete-synthesizer-voice-on-a-chip led to the Dark Energy's demise,
announced in February 2012. Instead of discontinuation, Doepfer sourced
new chip designs and released the Dark Energy II. The new model looks
almost identical to the original on the surface. But Doepfer did a lot
of redesigning under the hood.Gone is the triangle waveform, replaced by an inverse sawtooth and the
filter is a 12 dB/octave multi-mode affair (instead of the 24 dB lowpass
of the Dark Energy I), continuously variable from lowpass, through notch

original Dark Energy and the XFM control on the II allows for positive

Each of its knobs can send any MIDI message, including Control Change, Pitch Bend, Aftertouch, Note On,
and SysEx messages. You can use the Drehbank to get instant hands-on
access to any MIDI parameter in almost any piece of MIDI gear, including
new and old synthesizers, software and VST synths, rack effects, sound modules,
DAWs, and more!The Drehbank comes with presets for ReBirth, General MIDI mixing, and Yamaha groove boxes.
The bundled Emagic SoundDiver (Mac/Win) lets you create and save your own setups for the Drehbank!
The Drehbank also has a snapshot feature and two user defined banks for 128 total controls per setup.
It ships with 8 factory setups: 2 Rebirth, 2 Rmx1, controllers 1-64 (MIDI channel 1), controllers 65-128 (MIDI channel 1), 
selected Controllers (MIDI channel 1), and a GM mixer (MIDI channel 1-16). In addition to MIDI IN/OUT, there are 
8 CV inputs for external control voltages (0...+5V) and/or foot controllers. This allows you to control
MIDI parameters FROM your older vintage CV gea,r or as Doepfer would prefer, from their analog A-100
synth modules. But you cannot control CV from MIDI using the Drehbank, it's not a MIDI to CV converter!!
It is, however, a very easy to use and knobby way to get real hands-on with your MIDI gear or programs! It is used by Squarepusher.",

The A-Station
is polyphonic, adding 8 voices of polyphony to their 1-unit rack-mount
synth. Unlike the original Bass Station and Super
Bass Station which were real analog synths, the A-Station gets
its voice architecture from the SuperNova
synths, which use analog sound modeling. The A-Station has the layout
and shape of the famous Bass Stations, but its guts are basically a
slimmed down SuperNova.It has 25 knobs for real-time control, and all knobs transmit MIDI
controller messages. The A-Station has three oscillators which provide
sawtooth, triangle, sine and pulse width modulation. There's even a
simple FM synth engine which can be dialed in for sharpening the sound.
Oscillators may be set to Unison or Sync'd operation and a Noise source
is also included in the waveform engine. There is a nice lowpass
resonant filter with switchable 12 or 24dB/oct slopes and ADSR controls.
A second ADSR envelope is available for the oscillators, as well as two
LFOs with sample-and-hold and MIDI sync.On-board effects include reverb and delay. Their send levels can be
controlled by the Mod wheel which is a nice effect. A 12-band vocoder is
also on-board for processing external mono sounds such as drum loops or
vocals. The A-Station's pads sound great when vocoded with external
sounds. External sounds can also be used as an oscillator, run through
the filters, envelopes, etc. with much better results than were possible
on the original Bass Station. There's even a built-in Arpeggiator whose
speed synchronization and sweep range can be stored with the program for
instant recall. Unfortunately, some of the older Bass Station's problems
still have not been addressed in the A-Station. Namely, the lack of a
power switch, a puny 2-digit LCD screen, and it's still not
multitimbral. But for clean analog sounding synth bass, punchy leads,
pads, filter sweeps and more - the A-Station is certainly a great piece
of kit to have around! For a cool compact keyboard version check out the

pitch/mod wheels, frequency cutoff, resonance, filter modulation depth,
env1 attack, decay and env2 attack and decay.Unlike the Rack version, however, the keyboard lacks basic patch storage
features. There are only 7 memory patches and 1 manual patch (what the
knobs are doing right now). The memory can be stored externally using
MIDI SysEx dumps. But for the low price (under $500) this makes a great
and compact analog bass synth for any user with simple but tasteful bass
needs. It is used by Apollo 440, RZA, and Lo Fidelity AllStars.",

is great at recreating classic TB-303
lines and fat Moog tones. Every control from typical analog synths can be
found on this: ADSR, filter, oscillator sync modes, tuning, and LFO!
And most of these can be MIDI controlled.The Bass Station has dual-DCO's which are true analog oscillators, digitally synchronized, to
generate analog but stable sawtooth and pulse waveforms (the same waveforms offered by the TB-303). They can each be tuned, mixed
and synced together. The analog filter is a switchable 12 or 24dB/oct with
cutoff, resonance, envelope amount, and assignable ADSR. The LFO has
variable speed and delay with random, triangle or sawtooth shapes. The
LFO can modulate the filter and/or PWM.A very useful feature includes the built in MIDI/CV converter which allows
you to control the Bass Station from an older analog synth, or you can
control analog synths with MIDI through the Bass Station! All knob
settings are MIDI transmit/receivable and there are 60 user patches for
program storage. Another important feature is the analog input for
filtering external sound sources! The Bass
Station Keyboard was the original version but is a bit more limited than
this classic. It is used by William

famous sounds of the TR-909 and TR-808 drum machines via mix of Analog
Sound Modeling and sampled voices. On-board controls similar to the
classic TR machines provide knobs for individual drum sound level, tune,
attack and a few others to tweak the sounds in real-time.Compared to the Drum Station that came before it, the D-Station has a
few enhancements, namely 8-note polyphony from the former's 5-notes.
Besides a new look, the front panel features more robust and tactile rotary knobs.
While the D-Station still seems to be pretty slim on memory - only 40
patches - there are only 12 sounds in the thing, so 40 patches is
usually more than enough for designing drum kits with your own custom
tweaked sounds. You have total MIDI control of drum parameters and
the rotary controls transmit MIDI controller data. These can be
recorded into a sequencer and then played back to the D-Station which
responds by re-creating the changes in real-time. The only on-board effects
are Distortion and Front cut editing of the attack portion of drum sounds.Like the Drum and Bass Station before it, the D-Station further connects
this modern day drum synth to the TR machines of yesterday by including
a DIN Sync output. The D-Station converts MIDI Clock data into a Din Sync
control pulse which will allow any compatible unit (TB303, 
TR808, TR909 for example)
to run in synchronization with your MIDI equipment. If you want more than
just samples of the 808 or 909; if you want truly tweakable and analog sounding replicas,

Most of the editing features are easily accessible on the front panel, making it quick and easy to program. Deep editing isn't too difficult either, as the menu pages are laid out for quick access and once you've learned the system even the deepest menu options are only a few taps away. The controls on the Peak use 8-bit resolution as opposed to the 7-bit resolution of MIDI CCs. As a result, filter sweeps and other controller movements come out much smoother. Of course, the data is converted down to normal 7-bit MIDI for output.The real revolution in the Peak's design is how its oscillators work- the Peak's New Oxford Oscillators, a reference to where Huggett resides as well as bringing to mind the OSCar. Instead of using sample-based oscillators like many of the 80s hybrids did, or DSP-based oscillators like more recent hybrids, Peak uses FPGA-based oscillators running at 24 MHz to circumvent the usual sample rate limitations of sample and DSP oscillator designs. Analog-style waveforms are generated using a technique they call Numerically Controlled Oscillators where the FPGA works like an analog circuit but with precise control- pitch instability on the Peak is only when and how much you want it to be. The saw wave can be multiplied and detuned on the FPGA to create a triple saw with no impact on the synthesizer's polyphony.The other waveform generation technique is using wavetables. The Peak has 17 wavetables of five waveforms each and blends these waveforms to create smooth transitions. Unlike older wavetable synths, the Peak's wavetables are not band-limited, so are more harmonically rich and yet not as prone to aliasing as most other wavetable-based synthesizers.The oscillators also feature sync without using a slave oscillator and Linear FM, features that are standard on most Novation digital synthesizers. The Linear FM allows you to cross-modulate the oscillators and even allows you to do so in a recursive loop.The Peak's filter is a multimode self-resonant analog filter based off of the filter in the Bass Station II. It is a state-variable OTA filter that has both 12 and 24 dB slopes and can function in low-pass, band-pass and high-pass modes. Each filter also has its own pre-filter and post-filter analog distortion that ranges from a mild thickening of the filter's output to some serious analog distortion- and that is before you apply the analog distortion on the Peak's master outs. The VCAs on the Peak are analog as well and can be optionally gained up to overdrive the output.Peak has three digital effects at the end of its signal chain- reverb, delay and chorus- in addition to the aforementioned analog distortion. These digital effects are run on the FPGA at a sample rate of >90 KHz giving a very high quality I/O to these, or can be bypassed completely thus avoiding this ADC/DAC step.A 16-slot modulation matrix gives you deeper modulation possibilities than the default routings, with two sources and one destination available per slot.The synth is rounded out by USB MIDI and DIN MIDI in/out/thru, stereo out, a headphone jack, two pedal inputs, and a 1/8” CV in for accepting modulation from modular sources. Also included is a cloud-based patch librarian.The Novation Peak is a flexible, accessible polysynth capable of producing everything from smooth pads to highly distorted industrial sounds and everything in between, and is quite capable of filling many roles in anyone's synthesizer setup.",

It cleanly and nicely emulates and even transcends many classic synths like the Minimoog, Jupiter 8, Juno 106, and 2600! A 61-note professional keyboard version, seen below, doubles the polyphony to 32 voices and the memory to 1,024 patches.There is an upgraded model, the SuperNova II which greatly increases the polyphony, sonic possibilities and offers many more new knobs and functions.SuperNova IIIt also comes in a keyboard version which combines elegance, beauty, hands on control and a great 61 note velocity and aftertouch sensitive keyboard. Added features include new FM synthesis, ring-mod algorithms, two analog inputs and a 42-band vocoder effect.

The whole package includes a virtual analog synth, a midi controller, a 2 in / 2 out audio interface and an effect processor. It comes in both 25, 49 and 61 semi-weighted keys. This makes it sort of an all in one unit. The only things missing to really make it an all in one unit (e.g workstation) is a sampler, sequencer, and multitimbrality. The synth section is monotimbral, but hey must every synthesizer out where have multitimbrality? No, I would say. In this case, it’s one of the synths charms not to be able to do multitimbrality.
The synth engine includes 3 oscillators with 17 waves each and an independent noise source, a ring modulator, oscillator 1-2 sync and FM (2 operator FM synthesis). In the oscillator section, you find the standard analog waves like sinus, square/pulse, saw and triangle. Plus some noise sources and some really interesting digital waves that are sort of like wavetables or preset sounds. Making just the oscillator section alone very massive and huge when it comes to possibilities and making some interesting sound palettes. The filter onboard is a 12 dB / 24 dB multimode filter including low, band and highpass filtering. The section also includes a very interesting drive circuit. There is also two very interesting LFO’s with 32 waves each, two ADSR envelopes and an AD envelope for the FM synthesis with velocity.
Other things found in this synth include a portamento section (glide in some synths), unison, a very groovy and somewhat funky arpeggiator. An effect processor that’s makes anything sound big and large, a very addictive X/Y pad that in its default setting controls an filter of some sort (not sure what it is but it sounds awesome!).
So what are my general thoughts about this synth?
First of the build quality is a bit flimsy on this synth when it comes to the knobs (not the sliders), the combo jacks, headphones amplifier, the master amplifier for the main outs, the outer casing and the joystick locking mechanism. Do remember these are just some minor issues....
But apart from that THIS synth is truly a super flexible and a massive synthesizer that can produce both virtual analogue patches like bass, strings/pads, screaming bass- and lead patches, mild leads, FM, Yamaha GS 1 type of FM tones, PPG wave 2 (bells / wavetableish) “like” patches, ARP Solinaish patches and much more. Not to mention that this synth is a very groovy and a rhythmic synth due to some very nice sample and hold waves in the LFO’s and of course the funky arpeggiator section. Both the LFO’s, arpeggiator and the effects processor can be synced to an external midi clock.
This synth gets four stars out of five due to the synth engine being so good it overlooks the flimsy construction. Personally, I just love this awesome synthesizer since it never stops to amaze me every time I use it and tweak its sound.

scaled down X-Station. Actually, nothing could be farther from the
truth, it's just as powerful, if not more.Like the X-Station, the XioSynth (available in 25 or 49 keyboard
sizes) features Novation's X-Pad (X/Y touchpad) and pitch/mod joystick
controllers. The XioSynth retains all the features of the X-Station's
synthesis engine (except external audio processing), but it has at least
two new features that set it apart from its older sibling. First
there's the filter overdrive that's said to give the XioSynth
""grittier"" overtones. Secondly, there is the X-Gator patch programmer
which can gate each patch to create unique 16-32 step rhythmic patterns
for every onboard sound, all synchronized to MIDI clock. X-Gator adds a
unique flavor not heard on many other synths.XioSynth49The routing is fairly standard with the classic oscillator-filter-amp
layout. It boasts PWM, two LFOs, and a noise source. The first LFO is
for oscillator modulation and the second can be used for filter
modulation. The three oscillators each feature classic analog waveforms
plus some useful wavetables. Osc 1&2 can be sync'ed to each other.
The filter is a 2- or 4-pole capable of highpass, lowpass, and bandpass.
There are two envelopes: one for the amp and the other for the filter
(referred to as the ""mod envelope""). The XioSynth has six Effects, each
with adjustable levels and settings. These include: Delay, Reverb,
Chorus/Phaser, Distortion, a 3-Band EQ, and Stereo Panning.Programing the powerful synth engine is a breeze with the
matrix-style front panel which features 11 knobs and a rubber button to
go with each. In ""play mode"" the buttons perform simple on/off functions
but in ""edit mode"" each button brings up an edit menu where parameters
can be tweaked from the corresponding knob.Besides packing all this synthesis power in to a small frame,
Novation also decided to throw in a USB audio interface. The audio
quality may not be pristine, but it is very good considering XioSynth's
price point. As well as being a powerful synth and USB audio interface,
the XioSynth is also an awesome MIDI controller (every controller is
assignable). It can store 16 templates, which are all user editable via
the template editor. The editor can also act as an excellent patch
librarian for the synth. There is also a third party PC editor
available.The XioSynth has pair of left and right stereo outputs plus a
headphone output. There is also a duo of inputs: an XLR and a 1/4-inch
TRS. MIDI and audio are transmitted over USB, so an audio interface is
not needed to hear your shiny new XioSynth through your DAW. Sadly,
there is MIDI Out but no MIDI In or Through. Power for the XioSynth can
be provided by the included power supply, USB, or by six AA
batteries.All in all, the XioSynth is a great synth that will give you a lot of
bang for your buck. If you are looking for that K-Station sound at a much more
affordable price point, the XioSynth will do it",

Back then the company was exactly known for sampling, so the release of the A3000 was an unexpected one. The goal of Yamaha with the A3000 was to make a break-beat machine and phrase sampler that could be used for a wide variety of recording as well as performance applications.Although the A3000 is a capable machine, it is one that takes a lot of time and dedication to master. Right out of the box you are faced with an almost 400 page manual to introduce you to all the features and functions of the A3000. Although the A3000 only shipped with 2 megabytes of memory, it can accept expansion memory in the form of single in-line memory modules up to a maximum of 128MB. Seeing as 2 megabytes is barely enough for ten seconds of stereo sound, the ability to add more memory is a useful one. The A3000 can also accept another expansion in the form of an AIEB1 board. Without this board, this machine only supports analog I/O, despite storing all internal data in digital form. For direct digital I/O connectors the AIEB1 board is required as it features optical connectors and coaxial connectors along with three stereo assignable output pairs. New in the box, the A3000 included a power cord, MIDI cable, five floppy disks, owner's manual, power supply cable, SCSI cable as well as CD-ROM filled with samples. The A3000 handles sample processing with three independent effects blocks that can handle all the usual delay, reverb and chorus style effects. In addition, it can handle sample specific effects as well. Another thing that sets the A3000 apart at the time was that its effects could be accessed and applied in real time to any of its audio inputs, which means it made for a perfectly good stand alone effects processor.The 64 note polyphonic A3000 features a 4 band EQ system as well as parametric EQ. With five multi functional knobs on the front panel, it allows you to perform fast editing with real time control. Amongst the downsides of the A3000 is the small LED display that can only display two lines and an operating system that could be described as cumbersome at best. A big issue for a lot of A3000 users is trimming, which is incredibly difficult due to the small display. ",

it to CV (Hz/V like Korg not V/Oct) to get the extra voice. Each of the two VCOs has 
its own CV/Gate control. The best things about it are the flexibility of the VCFs and the routings
to the filters and envelopes. You can rout VCO 1 to both VCFs and the
VCFs to any of the envelopes positive or negative voltage. The VCFs
are 12 dB/Oct and are switchable between low, band or high-pass. They are the key 
to the nice sound of the Yamaha CS family. Other nice features are 
noise, external-in for processing other sounds, LFO with Sample & Hold 
for those bubbling sounds and an individual auto-bend for the VCOs.The CS-15 is great for strange blips, bass and tiny highpass sounds. 
The ADSRs aren't as fast as the CS-10 but they are ok. A nice feature is the 
'brilliance' slider that can control either or both VCFs. At their
extremely low prices, the CS-15 is an analog that's definitely worth checking out for yourself.

the CS-40m offered a more affordable approach to something other than a mono-synth.
It has a semi-compact 44 note (3 1/2 octave) keyboard, 36 knobs, 12 sliders and
over a dozen buttons for easy hands-on performance and editing. There are also
20 patches of memory which can be off-loaded to cassette tape.The CS-40m certainly isn't as phatt as the CS-80. In fact, the CS-40m is
more like a 2-voice version of the CS-20m. Like most CS-series synths
the CS-40m has two analog oscillators per voice.
Triangle, sawtooth, and square (pulse) waveforms are available on each
oscillator, plus there is a noise generator. There is also a simple AR (attack/release)
envelope generator for each VCO.The CS-40m has a multi-mode VCF (filter) switchable between lowpass, bandpass,
and highpass filtering. Basic filter cutoff and resonance controls are here,
but the filter's resonance can't be driven to self-oscillate. It does, however,
have its own ADSR envelope generator for nice sweeping filter effects.
There is a basic LFO (Low Frequency Modulator) for modulating the VCO, VCF or VCA.
All these classic controls and features and sounds... you would expect wood panels...
and there are! The CS-40m has been used by Electronic Dream Plant, Sneaker Pimps, Ultravox, Duran Duran, and Vangelis.",

keyboard sensitive to both velocity and aftertouch. The DX7 style membrane buttons have been replaced by
actual push-buttons, display screens and the overall layout of buttons
and diagrams is nicer and better organized.Sound-wise, the DX1 is like a fatter DX7. It
too features FM synthesis. That means that although the DX1 is a
digital synthesizer, its sounds are unique and fresh with an
analog/digital hybrid feel. Programming however, is not at all like
analog synth programming. All DX series synths use FM synthesis and all
are rather difficult to program or, at least, difficult to understand
what to program. Fortunately the advanced DX1 has display screens that
show amplitude modulation, envelopes, velocity, levels and de-tuning
parameters unlike previous DX synths so you can better visualize what
and how you are editing parameters. A neat new feature for the DX1 is
that two patches (Channel A and B) can be used simultaneously with the
keyboard in layer or split-mode. This mode is generally 16-voice
polyphonic, but with just one patch loaded you can have 32 voices of
thick polyphony! Pretty good for a synth over 15 years old!Although the DX1 may seem like a better buy than the more popular DX7, remember that the DX1 is expensive. There
were only about 140 of these synths made and the retail value of a DX1
during its production year in 1985 was $13,900. The DX1 was the most
expensive project Yamaha ever invested in. Expect to pay well over
$2,000 for one of these today. They were followed by the DX5. Under the hood, the DX5 is identical to the
DX1. The DX5 has done away with the heavy wood-paneling and has a less
fancy keyboard. The DX5 also has a more compressed layout of buttons,
sliders and diagrams on the front panel. The DX1, outdone by cheaper
and more competitive DX synths is today, primarily reserved for those
musicians big enough or wealthy enough to splurge on a real Vintage
instrument with exquisite performance and interface features and sounds.

Like all DX's it uses (FM) Frequency Modulation synthesis. It's not the easiest form of synthesis to program but can result in some excellent sounds. The DX100 is not as flexible nor powerful as a DX7, but it does have some cool sounds. It is most renowned for its great analog bass sound (Patch #01) that is awesome for techno, house, jungle, and acid music styles; it's very gritty, the bass tone with gristle! However, any other preset sounds that you'll find in the DX100 are pretty bad and require editing for anything else useable. The DX100 has mini-keys and only 49 of them. No filters, arpeggiators, effects or programmable controllers are available either. Small pitch and mod wheels in the upper left and guitar strap pegs make this synth usable for live use if you're feeling whimsical. If you mess around with the settings on Parameter 13, even if you don't know anything about FM, you can get some seriously twisted sounds out of it. If you're willing to spend a little time with it, it has a lot more potential than just that one bass sound that people will eventually get sick of. And at its currently low street price, it just might be worth getting. It is used by Orbital, Scanner, Jean-Michel Jarre, Autechre, Laurent Garnier, and countless other house and dance artists.",

The DX11's synthesis and sound quality is classic DX-style FM synthesis using 4-operators
per voice. The DX11 has one major advantage over the DX7 and other older DX-synths, however.
The DX11 offered 8-part multitimbrality, whereas older DX synths were monotimbral.
The DX11 is essentially a keyboard version of Yamaha's first true multitimbral
FM synthesizer, the TX81Z rack module. The DX11's multitimbral features allowed you to spread various sound patches across
different areas or ""zones"" of the keyboard. It also allowed for complex ensemble performances
using external sequencers or while playing live using ""Performance"" patches.
Also added were some Quick Edit functions so you don't have to delve into the complexity of FM 
synthesis to make a few simple tweaks. These quick edits affect the tone, envelope attack and release
times. Unfortunately there are no on-board arpeggiators or sequencers.The DX11 is only 8-voice polyphonic. A standard DX7 has 16-voices and though it
is monotimbral, superior polyphony makes the DX7 an often more popular choice. Also,
with just 8-voices, the DX11's multitimbral performances can wind up sounding pretty thin. Other
8-voice DX-type synths include the DX21, DX100, and TX81Z. And unlike most
previous DX synths which all used sine waves for synthesis, the DX11 offers up to eight
different waveforms to work with! And all the classic DX sounds
can be found in the DX11. Brass, piano, strings, bell sounds, percussion, effects,
and much more. Other features include chord-stacking, digital delay, and panning effects, 
however there is no chorus effect as on earlier DX-synths. At its current low second-hand
price, the DX11 is an inexpensive way to get useable DX sounds! It has been used by Astral Projection and Autechre.",

sound of FM synthesis. Based on the classic DX7, an authentic 6-operator FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis engine
sits at the heart of the DX200, bringing back the famous sounds of the DX-series synthesizers.
Taking a few clues from the success of Korg and Roland's desktop sequencing synthesizers, 
the DX200 is a realtime 16-step sequencer (groove-box) designed for musicians and DJs alike!
On top of that, the DX200 is fully compatible with DX7 System Exclusive MIDI data for
downloading DX7 patches into the DX200, and vice-versa!In addition to the 16-voice polyphonic FM synth sounds, the DX200 also provides 32 voices of AWM2
sample-playback for drum, percussion, bass, and rhythm sounds. There are over 120
sounds available to choose from; most are geared towards the dance genre. Sixteen realtime control
knobs provide hands on access to FM parameters, LFO, envelope, filter, and effects.
FM synthesis/programming has actually been somewhat simplified for use in the DX200.
One feature that was sorely missed in many classic DX-series synthesizers was the omission 
of filters. However, the new DX200 has an advanced resonant multi-mode filter with variable
12, 18 or 24 dB/oct slopes and lowpass, hipass, bandpass, and band reject modes. The lowpass
features a dedicated envelope generator. The ADSR envelope can control both the filter and the Amp.
Also onboard are portamento, polyphonic, mono, and unison modes. The LFO features up to 21
waveforms and can modulate either the pitch or filter.Although the DX200 can be used as an FM sound module via MIDI, its advanced sequencer
makes it an excellent all-in-one FM groove machine! And with all those classic FM sounds 
(punchy bass, ambient textures, metallic sounds, etc.) the DX200 is definitely set apart from other similar 
groove machines. The sequencer section is also modeled after classic analog style sequencers.
A simple turn of a knob can control each step of the current pattern. That is - 
for each of its 16 steps per pattern, the pitch, gate time and velocity can be independently
tweaked in realtime. The sequencer offers one track for your FM sounds, and three additional tracks
for the AWM2 rhythm sounds. Each track can be assigned to individual MIDI channels.
Patterns can be created live in realtime or carefully programmed in step-mode, and they can
be chained together for up to 10 songs. Songs can be exported via MIDI for use in sequencers or
off-line storage. Motion Control is also implemented in the DX200 via the Free EG. It's an 
envelope generator that gives up to 4 tracks for recording parameter tweaks giving complex, 
evolving motion to your sounds and patterns! All knobs transmit MIDI control change messages too.
Yamaha's Scene Memory function is also onboard for quickly storing tweaked parameters for instant
recall or to ""morph"" between the two scene memories in realtime! The two scene
memories are stored with each pattern.Although the realtime control is essential for the DJ, the DX200 also comes
with tools for the studio musician! A great software editor package is bundled with the DX200
for even easier editing via external computer (Mac/PC). The software editor
provides in-depth editability and control, such as the ability to hand-draw
envelopes, and much more. A graphic simulation of the DX7 is included as well as the ability
to import original DX7 sounds and patterns. In the end, the DX200 is a God-send for any musician looking for those classic 
DX/FM sounds without all the hassles and complexity of programming and maintaining 
the old synths that provided them. The DX200 has realtime control, built-in realtime 
sequencing, filters, morphing ability and much more! At such a reasonable price, the 
DX200 just may transcend its classic ancestors.",

synthesizers. Under the hood the DX5 is almost identical to the DX1 except the DX5 has done away with the heavy
wood-paneling and has a less fancy keyboard (no more ployphonic
aftertouch) and is more affordable. With its dual 6-operator FM synth
engines the DX5 is like having two DX7
synthesizers in one, and then some! The DX5 has 64 performance memories
which can be loaded or saved to cartridge, while the DX7 has only one
manual performance memory. This improves the versatility for live
performance and makes excellent use of the dual engines. However, one
thing to consider is that the MIDI implementation, while adequate, does
not qualify it as a master keyboard, in particular, the DX5 (like the
DX7) sends only 99 as the maximum velocity, not 127. In addition, the
DX5 is slightly noisier than the DX7.Although the DX5 is a digital synthesizer, its sounds are unique and
fresh with an analog/digital hybrid feel. Programming however, is not at
all like analog synth programming. All DX series synths use Frequency
Modulation (FM) synthesis and all are rather difficult to program or, at
least, difficult to understand what to program. The DX5 is no exception
to this rule except that its layout, parameter buttons and displays are
much better than typical DX synths.For performances, the DX5 shares the DX1's
bitimbric ability to play two patches from memory (Channel A and B) with
the keyboard in layer or split mode and the polyphony reduced from 32 to
16 voices. That's a very cool ability for an old synth, especially a DX
type synth. Imagine playing bass in one hand and some other wacky sounds
in the other hand. You'd have to get a couple TX7s or DX7s to achieve
that otherwise (of course this may be cheaper than getting a DX5
anyway). The DX5 remains a very high quality vintage instrument and if
you've got the money to burn and a desire for a unique instrument from
the DX line of synths, this is the one! It has been used by

It featured a whole new type of synthesis called FM (Frequency Modulation). It certainly is not analog and it is difficult to program but can result in some excellent sounds! It is difficult because it is non-analog and thus, a whole new set of parameters are available for tweaking, many of which seemed counter-intuitive and unfamiliar. And programming had to be accomplished via membrane buttons, one data slider and a small LCD screen.Still the sounds it shipped with and that many users did manage to create were more complex and unique than anything before it. Percussive and metallic but thick as analog at times, the DX7 was known for generating unique sounds still popular to this day. The DX7 was also a truly affordable programmable synth when it was first released. Almost every keyboardist bought one at the time making the DX7 one of the best selling synths of all time! It also came with MIDI which was brand new at the time - Sequential had already released the first MIDI synth, the Prophet 600. Roland had just released the JX-3P with very basic MIDI implementation, and wouldn't get around to adding full MIDI for another year with the Juno-106, and it would be three years before Roland can counter the popularity of the DX7 with a digital synth of their own, the D-50. The DX7 has been used by the Crystal Method, Kraftwerk, Underworld, Orbital, BT, Talking Heads, Brian Eno, Tony Banks, Mike Lindup of Level 42, Jan Hammer, Roger Hodgson, Teddy Riley, Brian Eno, T Lavitz of the Dregs, Sir George Martin, Supertramp, Phil Collins, Stevie Wonder, Daryl Hall, Steve Winwood, Scritti Politti, Babyface, Peter-John Vettese, Depeche Mode, D:Ream, Les Rhytmes Digital, Front 242, U2, A-Ha, Enya, The Cure, Astral Projection, Fluke, Kitaro, Vangelis, Elton John, James Horner, Toto, Donald Fagen, Michael McDonald, Chick Corea, Level 42, Queen, Yes, Michael Boddicker, Julian Lennon, Jean-Michel Jarre, Sneaker Pimps, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Greg Phillanganes, Jerry Goldsmith, Jimmy Edgar, Beastie Boys, Stabbing Westward and Herbie Hancock. Pretty impressive for just a partial listing! Following the monaural DX7 came the stereo DX7 mkII - just as popular and much more advanced. Its unique sounds are very popular for industrial techno type music as well as ambient and electro. The TX-7 is essentially a desktop module form of the DX7 but is even harder to edit or program since it requires external editors or software. The monolithic DX1 and DX5 models which packed two DX7 synth engines into one instrument were the epitome of the DX line of synths created by Yamaha. There have also been a few budget spin-offs like the DX9, DX100, DX21 and DX27. FM synthesis has also made its way into the TX-81Z & TX-802 and software synthesizers like Native Instruments FM7.Still the DX7 has remained the all around best and most popular DX synth due to its affordable price, professional features for studio and live performance and its excellent range of sonic possibilities and extensive programmability. In fact the reason the DX7 is always so affordable (usually under $500 second-hand) is because there are so many of them out there, still being used and traded! And they are reliable, still functioning well over 20 years later unlike older analog gear.",

larger than before. Internally, the biggest improvement is the updated
16-bit digital circuitry for cleaner and much less noisy sound quality.
Patch memory has also been doubled from 32 to 64 voices. Additional
general improvements include enhanced MIDI support, micro-tuning
capabilities, aftertouch controlled pitch bending, and multiple
LFOs.The DX7IID and DX7IIFD (pictured) models also added
bi-timbrality with keyboard split and layering capabilities. This allows
two voices to be layered in dual mode, providing very rich combinations
of sounds that would otherwise be impossible with the original DX7.
Voices could also be split across the keyboard, for a two part
multi-timbral performance capability; again, impossible with the
original DX7 (or the DX7S, as the S stands for single
timbre).The DX7IIFD added a Floppy Drive (that's what the FD stands
for) offering one megabyte of memory space (equal to 40 RAM cartridges)

analog flavor to your recordings and live performances. The ED10
consists of a sizable, velocity sensitive rubber pad and a small
built-in synthesizer.It creates drum sounds using a real analog VCO (with a large pitch
range), a noise source and a ""sub-sonic"" oscillator, which
adds a ring mod-like effect to the sound. These three sound sources are
then shaped with a pitch envelope, an amplitude envelope and a
non-resonant low-pass filter. You have lots of control over all of these
functions using the machine's ten knobs, which can also affect the
filter-env modulation or add a ""click"" to your sound to make
it more percussive. One important thing to mention is that the envelopes
are velocity sensitive, giving you lots of expressive potential.This drum pad came from a range that included different mixers and racks
so you could build a complete electronic drum kit! Useful features like
the ""mix audio input"" (which adds external signals to the
drum's output) and the daisy chain-able power supply, seem to reflect
this modular form factor.Not much of a drummer? No worries! You can trigger the ED10 using audio!
Simply send a rim shot from your DAW into the ED10's trigger input, and
it will happily play along with your project! It will respond to
velocity too (i.e.: quieter or louder impulses) and is almost as good as
MIDI! It also triggers nicely from another drum machine.The sounds on this unit are sheer analog bliss: Punchy synth-pop snares,
cheesy disco tom toms, sharp analog hi-hats and many more classic
sounds. By triggering the unit externally and messing with the knobs,
you can even get some rather experimental crazy sci-fi sounds out of it!They're pretty cheap on eBay, so why not pick up one or two?",

unique Extended Synthesis system which incorporates a number of the most
advanced tone generator technologies currently available...plus a
full-featured sampling system. It offers a Four-Element Voice structure which allows for up to
four independent waves from any of the tone generators. The tone generators
implemented here include AWM2 (Advanced Wave Memory) Synthesis, AN (Analog Physical Modeling) Synthesis,
FDSP (Formulated Digital Sound Processing) Synthesis and Virtual Acoustic
(VL) Synthesis. According to Yamaha:""AWM is Yamaha's original system for effectively using sampled waveforms in
synthesizers and tone generators. The strength of AWM synthesis lies not
only in its extraordinary ability to ""shape"" and control the sound of the
samples with a comprehensive system of envelope generators, filters, key
scaling parameters, modulation, and more.
AWM voices can have from 1 to 4 AWM elements. Each AWM element can use a
preset wave or a sampled waveform. The ability to combine AWM elements
means that you can, for example, combine separate samples for the attack
and sustain portions of an instrument's sound, with independent control
over each.Yamaha AN Synthesis (Analog Physical Modeling) offers all the benefits of
traditional analog synthesis with the stability, reproducability, and
precise control of digital technology. It is capable of accurately
reproducing the sound of classic analog synthesizers without patch cables,
setting charts, or the frustrating instability that was the bane of the
analog age.
A standard (Poly) AN voice can have 1 AN element and from 1 to 3 AWM
elements. Classic analog synth type sounds can be created with the single
AN element alone. AWM elements can be added as necessary to ""modernize""
the sound.FDSP adds a sophisticated note-dependent effect processor to the basic AWM
synthesis system. In contrast to a stand effect stage, the FDSP synthesis
stage uses individual note and velocity data to control effect parameters,
thus making it possible to simulate the characteristics of a number of
real-world musical components, as well as produce totally new effects.
FDSP can produce totally new sounds that are responsive and ""alive"".
FDSP voices have from 1 to 4 AWM elements with an FDSP stage between the
elements and the main effect stage. The FDSP stage can be applied to any
or all of the AWM elements used, as required.Yamaha's Virtual Acoustic
(""VL"") Synthesis tone generation system applies sophisticated computer
based ""physical modeling"" technology to musical sound synthesis,
accurately simulating the very complex vibrations, resonances, reflections
and other acoustic phenomena that occur in a real wind or string
instrument. VL voices can have 1 VL element and from 1 to 3 AWM elements. The VL
element can be used alone to emphasize the full realism and expressive
power of the VL tone generator, or with added AWM elements for thicker
textures.The EX5 allows the AN and FDSP tone generator systems to be combined in
""AN + FDSP"" voices which can have 1 AN element and from 1 to 3 FDSP
elements. The FDSP stage can be applied to any or all of the AWM elements
used, as required.""The EX5 also features sophisticated sampling capability. Samples can
be used in AWM voice elements or mapped to and played via
individual keys of the keyboard using the Key Map mode. It is also
possible to sample internal sounds created in the EX5. The Sample mode
has all the features you'd expect from a professional sampler and is
compatible with WAV, AIFF and AKAI formats. Sampled waveforms can be saved 
to floppy disk or to an external storage device via the optional
ASIB1 SCSI Interface.The features don't stop there. Six Controller Knobs can be assigned to a 
wide range of parameters for extraordinary real-time control capability
along with the Pitch wheel, two Mod wheels, assignable Ribbon Controller and Scene memory
buttons. Two types of full featured built-in Sequencers are on-board.
A 16-Track Song Sequencer has real-time play effects and ""groove"" quantization.
An 8-Track Pattern Sequencer has most of the functions and features of
the 16-track song sequencer, but is more suited to the production of drum tracks, dance
grooves, or other frequently used phrases. There's also a great 
4-track Arpeggiator with 50 preset and user patterns. Top-quality digital effects processors of two types are onboard.
The ""System"" effects includes two separate effect units: Reverb and Chorus.
Independent reverb and chorus settings can be made for each voice in the Voice mode, and for each
performance setup in the Performance mode. Two ""Insertion"" effects provide up
to 79 additional effects like chorus, distortion and overdrive, amp simulation, auto wah,
equalization, delay, reverb, and other effects.Use the 16-part Performance mode to create elaborate sequences, layer sounds
and so on. Different parts can be assigned to different areas of
the keyboard, there are up to 16 zones. The EX Key Map mode allows you to assign individual samples, patterns, or
pattern tracks to different keys of the keyboard. These can then be played
or triggered from the keyboard or an external sequencer or other MIDI controller.
Every knob and controller on the keyboard sends and receives MIDI data in real-time.The EX5 is also available as a rack-module, the EX5R.The less expensive EX7 is a ""lite"" version of the EX5. It has a smaller 61 note keyboard
and has no ""VL"" synthesis nor ""AN + FDSP"" mode. However, the EX series represents
a giant leap forward in synthesizer technology from Yamaha! There is apparently a limited edition version of the EX5 that
was either released as a ""Millenium Edition"", or marked the end of the
production line (pictured above).  It was only available in the Aisian market, so
picking one of these up in the states would be a very rare find! 
Supposedly, only 2000 of these were slated for production, but only
around 500 of them made it off the production lines. All of the specs of
the EX5s are exactly the same as the EX5 except the EX5s is in a silver housing.  ",

unique Extended Synthesis system which incorporates a number of the most
advanced tone generator technologies currently available...plus a
full-featured sampling system. It offers a Four-Element Voice structure which allows for up to
four independent waves from any of the tone generators. The tone generators
implemented here include AWM (Advanced Wave Memory) Synthesis, AN (Analog Physical Modeling) Synthesis and
FDSP (Formulated Digital Sound Processing) Synthesis. According to Yamaha:""AWM is Yamaha's original system for effectively using sampled waveforms in
synthesizers and tone generators. The strength of AWM synthesis lies not
only in its extraordinary ability to ""shape"" and control the sound of the
samples with a comprehensive system of envelope generators, filters, key
scaling parameters, modulation, and more.
AWM voices can have from 1 to 4 AWM elements. Each AWM element can use a
preset wave or a sampled waveform. The ability to combine AWM elements
means that you can, for example, combine separate samples for the attack
and sustain portions of an instrument's sound, with independent control
over each.Yamaha AN Synthesis (Analog Physical Modeling) offers all the benefits of
traditional analog synthesis with the stability, reproducability, and
precise control of digital technology. It is capable of accurately
reproducing the sound of classic analog synthesizers without patch cables,
setting charts, or the frustrating instability that was the bane of the
analog age.
A standard (Poly) AN voice can have 1 AN element and from 1 to 3 AWM
elements. Classic analog synth type sounds can be created with the single
AN element alone. AWM elements can be added as necessary to ""modernize""
the sound.FDSP adds a sophisticated note-dependent effect processor to the basic AWM
synthesis system. In contrast to a stand effect stage, the FDSP synthesis
stage uses individual note and velocity data to control effect parameters,
thus making it possible to simulate the characteristics of a number of
real-world musical components, as well as produce totally new effects.
FDSP can produce totally new sounds that are responsive and ""alive"".
FDSP voices have from 1 to 4 AWM elements with an FDSP stage between the
elements and the main effect stage. The FDSP stage can be applied to any
or all of the AWM elements used, as required.""The EX7 also features sophisticated sampling capability. Samples can
be used in AWM voice elements or mapped to and played via
individual keys of the keyboard using the Key Map mode. It is also
possible to sample internal sounds created in the EX7. The Sample mode
has all the features you'd expect from a professional sampler and is
compatible with WAV, AIFF and AKAI formats. Sampled waveforms can be saved 
to floppy disk or to an external storage device via the optional
ASIB1 SCSI Interface.The features don't stop there. Six Controller Knobs can be assigned to a 
wide range of parameters for extraordinary real-time control capability
along with the Pitch wheel, two Mod wheels, assignable Ribbon Controller and Scene memory
buttons. Two types of full featured built-in Sequencers are on-board.
A 16-Track Song Sequencer has real-time play effects and ""groove"" quantization.
An 8-Track Pattern Sequencer has most of the functions and features of
the 16-track song sequencer, but is more suited to the production of drum tracks, dance
grooves, or other frequently used phrases. There's also a great 
4-track Arpeggiator with 50 preset and user patterns. Top-quality digital effects processors of two types are onboard.
The ""System"" effects includes two separate effect units: Reverb and Chorus.
Independent reverb and chorus settings can be made for each voice in the Voice mode, and for each
performance setup in the Performance mode. Two ""Insertion"" effects provide up
to 79 additional effects like chorus, distortion and overdrive, amp simulation, auto wah,
equalization, delay, reverb, and other effects.Use the 16-part Performance mode to create elaborate sequences, layer sounds
and so on. Different parts can be assigned to different areas of
the keyboard, there are up to 16 zones. The EX Key Map mode allows you to assign individual samples, patterns, or
pattern tracks to different keys of the keyboard. These can then be played
or triggered from the keyboard or an external sequencer or other MIDI controller.
Every knob and controller on the keyboard sends and receives MIDI data in real-time.The EX5 is a bigger version of the EX7. It has a larger 76 note keyboard with 
initial and aftertouch responses. It also features Yamaha's Virtual Acoustic synthesis
and the AN and FDSP generators can be combined in ""AN + FDSP"" mode. The EX5 is also available 
as a rack-module, the EX5R. The EX series represents a giant leap forward in synthesizer technology from Yamaha! ",

Yamaha released a new FM powerhouse...the FS1R. This little beast is far
from your average FM synthesizer. Not only is it an eight-Operator
variant, as opposed to the six- and four-Operator FM of the DX/TX lines,
but it also features a new technology called Formant Shaping Synthesis.
Formants are the spectral patterns making up the sounds of human speech.
This allows for the creation of vocal like timbres but can also be
applied in many different ways to create incredibly unique sounds that
you won't find on any other synths.DX7 aficionados will like the fact that the FS1R has almost complete
compatibility with 6-Operator FM synths: you can send, via MIDI, a patch
from a DX7, for example, and the FS1R will convert it to an
identical-sounding patch in the new synth. A lot of the preset Voices
actually come from the DX7's library. It's also possible to program
sounds from DX7 sound charts, finding an algorithm that has an
equivalent layout to the DX algorithm and turning off the unwanted
Operators.The downside to the FS1R is the complexity of the user interface. With a
tiny LCD screen and hundreds if not thousands of menus and sub-menus,
editing from the front panel is tedious and nearly impossible.
Thankfully, there are now software editors available for both the Mac
and PC platforms to make the process quite a bit easier (though still
not perfect). All that said, the complexity of working with the synth is
far outweighed by the amazing sounds that it's capable of. It truly
sounds like nothing else out there. From huge evolving pads, to
shimmering EPs, fantastic organs, screaming leads and booming basses..
this synth can sound industrial and cold one minute, and then warm and
almost analogue the next. With some time dedicated to learning how to
edit the patches, or create your own from scratch, there's really no
sound that this synth isn't capable of making.After an abysmal showing on the market, the FS1R was discontinued after
only about one year. These days, more people have discovered what this
synth is capable of and it has seen a resurgence in popularity and has
reached an almost cult-like status. It is rare to find one for sale
these days, and when you do, the prices seem to be climbing.If you have a short attention span and no patience, this may not be the
synth for you. If you're someone who doesn't mind programming a synth to
get the most out of it and you're looking for some of the most amazing
and unique sounds ever produced by an FM synthesizer, the FS1R is a must
have. It has been used by Squarepusher and Sin.",

ribbon controller, eight polyphonic voices, chromed pedestals and a
$50,000+ price tag! OK, so it wasn't designed for your everyday musician
- less than 10 were ever made and have been owned mostly by legendary
synth/keyboard players including Keith Emmerson, John Paul Jones of
Led Zeppelin, Stevie Wonder, Rick Wright, George Fleury, Richard James of Aphex Twin, ABBA, and Hans

heaven inside! The two main keyboards have 61 (velocity sensitive!) keys
each, and are supplemented by a smaller (3/4 scale, pressure sensitive)
37-note keyboard and a 25-note pedalboard at your feet - 184 keys total!
Eight voices of polyphony plus an additional monophonic are available
and can be shared and layered or split up among the different keyboards.
There are also organ-style drawbars and a ribbon controller for tweaking
the sounds. Additional programming buttons are hidden away under drawers
and panels on the front-panel.The GX-1 used two analog oscillators per voice which are pretty much the
same one's used later in the CS-80, along with a mild 2-pole VCF (filter),
standard LFO and some ADSR envelopes. The GX-1 also had two ""swell""
pedals and a spring-loaded knee controller. It was truly a lush synth

history! Originally released in 2001 by Yamaha, the Motif is a music workstation
that really has it all and has grown over the years in polyphony and waveform memory
with the ES (2003) and XS (2007) series. Its features include Yamaha's AWM2 tone generators,
massive polyphony (62 to 128 notes), an excellent sequencer, a sampler, A/D Audio
inputs, AIEB2, mLAN compatibility, and stereo inputs. Between the various models, it
has anywhere from 84MB to 355MB of sounds for thousands of waveforms. Its mLAN compatibility
works great with Cubase LE (which usually comes included in the
package). The Motif Classic, Motif ES, and Motif XS all came in 61, 76, and 88 key
versions, and the 88-key models are always balanced hammer-action as
well. The Motif is a perfect synthesizer/workstation for studio
use as well as live applications.Motif ES7The sounds found on the Motif are conveniently arranged into categories
according to their type, such as Piano, Organ, Strings, Leads, Pads, FX,
Drums, etc. It has preset voices which are made up of up to 4 of the
available waveforms which can be edited individually or all together. There are plenty of
drums kits, and 128 to 384 user voices that you can use to create your own
sounds or save edited presets in. The workstation also includes Yamaha's
""Megavoice"" technology which adds immense realism to its acoustic
sounds such as its guitars, basses, pianos, brass, strings, and so on.
Megavoice technology provides realistic expressions such as hammer-ons,
ghost notes, slides, and fret noises which are all activated depending
on how much force you apply to the keys. The quality of the voices will
leave you stunned, the acoustic sounds are extremely realistic and of
excellent quality and the synthetic sounds are mind-bending. All of the
voices can be edited in just about anyway you want as well, such as
Cutoff, Resonance, standard Attack/Release. Of course, you also have
your Octave Up/Down buttons (not included on the 88-key versions), Pitch
Bend wheel, Modulation wheel and a Ribbon controller (ES, XS, MO models), which can be
assigned to do different functions. The tone generator is also
compatible with Yamaha's Modular Synthesis Plug-In boards which you
simply install and you instantly have a vast array of even more new sounds.Motif XS8The sequencer is just awesome. Once you get passed the user-interface
(which we'll come back to shortly) the sequencer has all the great
features you need to compose your music without having to get up from your
seat. There are 16 tracks which you can record the voices on the synth
itself or that you can transfer MIDI data into which is particularly
good for percussion tracks if you aren't that good with keeping rhythm,
though it does have a built in clicking/flashing metronome. It has multiple
sliders which normally act as faders, and there are knobs to adjust different
parameters. You can also plug another instrument like a guitar, bass, or
another synth into it and use the synth's numerous effects like Chorus,
Celeste, Flanger, Phaser, Distortion, Overdrive, and so many more.Motif Rack ESThe disadvantages: When compared to its rivals (Roland Fantom-X and
Korg Triton) the major disadvantage is the user-interface, as mentioned
above. The screen was left as a simple LCD screen in order to keep the
price a decent amount whereas the Roland Fantom series and Korg Triton
series have large color LCD displays. The XS model does, however, have a
much improved large LCD screen to address this issue. The Korg Triton's
display was also touch screen. Fortunately for Motif users, the controls
were easy to learn after a short amount of time. I'm aware that I'm leaving out a lot of features such as the Arpeggiator
and Remote/mLAN features but there's just so much to explain and so many
things this workstation is capable of. You'll just have to try it out
yourself! There are so many models to choose from, it should not be hard to find one that
works for you - in terms of keyboard size, polyphony & waveform memory, or pricing.
While on the topic of different Motif models, here are all the different models:Motif: The workstation that started the series in 2001:Motif ES: The successor to the original Motif, featuring more voices, polyphony and more studio features:Motif MO: A sort of ""lite"" version of the Motif ES which had less polyphony and waveforms, but of equal quality. It also lacked the studio features such as mLAN connectivity, sampling and multiple foot controllers and only came in 61 and 88 key models:Motif XS: The latest version of the Motif series with more voices, nearly twice the amount of waveforms and ROM, and the much needed larger, full-color LCD display plus more sliders and knobs:The Motif (as a series) has been used by countless famous artists:

This is the type of keyboard that would not be surprising to find in the musical instrument section of a major toy store. It's a simple synth built in a plastic case, with built-in stereo speakers, stereo outputs and 49 mini-sized keys. It's designed to be lightweight and portable. Yet at its heart it has inherited Yamaha's DX series digital FM synthesis, which is enough to garner this synth some attention. There are 21 preset sounds, all of which sound pretty silly. Fortunately, Yamaha included a section called ""Digital Synthesizer"" which is essentially a manual editing mode. In this mode, six sliders at the top right of the instrument allow you to shape DX/FM sounds. It is a very limited and simplified means of FM synthesis, but for many users this freedom from the complexity of having to attempt to craft FM sounds could be quite fun! The WAVE slider steps through a few very basic waveforms. The SPECTRUM slider is akin to a DX's frequency setting. The MODULATION is more of a timbre/brightness control that renders the sound from dull to bright, which is almost like filtering. The ATTACK and DECAY sliders both control the characteristics of the envelope. There is also a VOLUME slider which controls the output level of the synthesizer section.Typical of this style of all-in-one synthesizer for casual consumers, is the built-in rhythm and accompaniment sections. The rhythm section offers 12 drum patterns which are comparable to Casio synths like the VL-Tone VL-1, with patterns like Bossa Nova, Rock, Disco and March/Waltz. They are pretty silly. But once again Yamaha did go one step further by adding the ""Custom Drummer"" which allows you to add some additional drum hits to the current pattern, to give it a little extra flavor of your own. There are only five of these drum sounds - the basics - kick, snare, tom, cymbal and hi-hat.There is also the ""Auto-Bass-Chord"" accompaniment section which will play a chord and bass line appropriate to the selected rhythm pattern. Chords are selected from the lower octave-and-a-half of the keyboard, so you can play the melody/lead in the upper octave. The rhythm section also offers ""Fill-In"" and ""Variation"" buttons to keep your rhythm pattern from getting too boring. Another nice feature Yamaha added was individual volume controls for the ""Auto-Bass-Chord"" and Drum sections.At the end of the day, the PSS-470 seems like a pretty advanced synth-toy, but still one that no real musician would consider using. However, the PSS-470 is so cheap that not only does it provide DX sounds at a bargain price, but circuit-bending these things has become quite common. That means some pretty wacky and unique things can be done, or have already been done to this synth. And with just enough quality touches added by Yamaha that make it a little more flexible than its Casio contemporaries, the PSS-470 could actually prove quite useful and exciting!",

Synth parameters can be edited with precision, but only one at a time. 5 user patches may be saved to memory, which is retained when the unit is powered off.The Synth section offers a depth of control that allows for smooth, refined sounds, as well as the glitchy, noisy stuff you'd expect from a strange cheap little digital synth. Although the envelope generator is terribly primitive and there's no real way to control the release, the sounds that come from a well-programmed patch can be surprisingly professional-sounding... or simply bizarre. Fine control over the decay envelope allows for all kinds of percussion sounds, so it's great to pair this synth with a nice percussion sampler.Unlike the other PortaSound synthesizers, the PSS-480 offers control over the frequency of both operators, as well as over the depth of the feedback. In terms of controlling the depth of modulation, the whole range from zero to 99 is available, so it's fun and easy to find sweet spots and balance the sound out by adjusting the feedback amount. Each operator's frequency can be set in multiples from 1 to 15, allowing a fantastic amount of control over the basic character of the sound.On these synths in this family with this primitive yet powerful architecture, good sounds are found through exploration. It's not exactly FM synthesis, but it's close. It's almost a limited 2 operator FM synth, in terms of programming, but it does strange things that an FM synth wouldn't. Allowing for sounds ranging from glassy to brassy to outright demonic and beyond, the PSS-480 makes up in power what it lacks in predictability. Textured sci-fi bass, reedy pads, blistering vocal-sounding leads, smooth swells... this synth will do it all, in a quirky, beautiful, strange and very digital way.In terms of built-in percussion, Yamaha stuck the 480 with a set of samples that's virtually useless. Compared with the 470's silly yet tight percussion sounds, they're low-fi to the point of sounding broken.In addition to the fantastic synth section, the 480 offers the type of accompaniment features characteristic of the PortaSound line, offering bassline and chord accompaniment in various styles and patterns. There's just enough control over the accompaniment section, and just enough variety, to make it useful for auditioning ideas or even for recording, as long as the percussion is left out. The bass and chord sections can be balanced against the synth section, and the three parts of the synth function well together to produce a big, beefy, synthy wall of sound.The keyboard itself is four octaves of mini keys. They're very small and very short, requiring a high degree of dexterity and precision, but allowing for very large chords to be played easily. The synth section packs more than enough polyphony for two hands, but doesn't offer a monophonic or unison mode. Many sources erroneously claim it to have 8 voices, but it actually has 12. It's possible to tweak your way into an undocumented monophonic mode, however.All in all, the Yamaha Portasound PSS-480 packs a surprising amount of power and can deliver both mainstream and experimental sounds that go way beyond its price point. It's annoying to program while you're trying to play it, but it's easy to get familiar with, and it allows for total access to the hardware inside. And in such a cheap synth, that's a great thing.",

110,000 notes, 48 Tracks (32 Linear, 16 Pattern) and 20 Songs. A
built-in 3.5 inch disk drive provides external storage. The sequencer has
64 notes of polyphony which is usually more than enough. The sequencer
allows recording in Step, Punch-In, and Realtime with overdubbing
features. The tempo can range from 5 to 300 bpm and the Conductor Track
is very flexible. Thankfully a fairly large  320 x 240 backlit LCD
screen makes entry and editing very easy to see and use.In addition to controlling your synths via MIDI, the QY700 has it's own
Yamaha synth engine inside. Using AWM2 - Advanced Wave Memory - as well as
Yamaha's XG format and good old General MIDI sounds, the QY700 has an
ample selection of quality digital sounds ready to use! You get nearly
4,000 drums, bass, guitar, and synth sounds. There's even a library of
Phrases like intro, fill and ending patterns that you can use. These
phrases are highly tweakable and can be made all your own. There's also
Chord memory and plenty of built-in effects to use on the internal
sounds as well. The QY700 even has a pseudo 2-octave keyboard and
assignable mini Pitch/Mod wheels, and programmable foot switches for
start, stop, fill, etc. Additional MIDI I/O's and outputs would have been 
nice, but it's still a capable and musical sequencer.",

machine—in 1986, the RX5 was Yamaha's flagship drum machine.
Although its vintage appeal may be diminished by the Roland R-8 (as well as the resurgence of the
TR-808 and TR-909 machines), if you're on a budget,
this one could be for you.The RX5 has many features that other drum machines simply do not
have. Aside from all of the basics, such as pitch adjustment, level
control, etc., this machine also features ""Attack"" and ""Decay"" envelope
controls and two levels of ""Accent"" for each sound, allowing you to
really change the character of any of its 24 built-in sounds. The sounds
range from surprisingly real and punchy kicks and snares, to gunshots,
door slams, even guitar and bass samples.The RX5 features a RAM/ROM cartridge slot for storing custom edited
sounds and loading in new sounds as well (adding an additional 28 sounds
to the 24 built-in). Any sound can be assigned along the top row of pads
(the bottom row are preset to the usual suspects—kick, snare,
toms, hats, etc.), allowing you to customize your drum kit. Make an
orchestra of handclaps, bass drums, or guitars! You can create and store
up to three custom drum kits.Another interesting feature of the RX5 is its pitch envelope. There
are two simple parameters: ""Bend Amount"" and ""Bend Rate"". With this
feature, you can make any sound pitch-bend downwards or upwards, across
several octaves. This effect can be stored as part of your custom edited
sound at the touch of a few buttons.Also overlooked but extremely useful are the ""Reverse"" and ""Damp""
functions. You can record a reverse crash cymbal at one point in a drum
pattern, and switch back to a regular crash cymbal elsewhere in the same
pattern. The ""Damp"" function emulates the dampening of a drum head or a
cymbal choke. Many drum machines overlook these useful functions, which
can really help add a touch more authenticity and nuance to your drum
patterns.The sequencer section can record up to 100 patterns with time
signatures ranging from 01/32 to 99/2 in either Real Time or Step Time
record modes. Real Time recorded patterns can be quantized to the
nearest 1/2 to 1/48 note. Patterns can be arranged in up to 30 Songs.
And Songs can be chained together to form complete performance sets. All
sequence data can also be offloaded to external RAM cartridge or
cassette tape interface.It is also worth mentioning that the RX5 has a 12 channel mixer with
stereo out plus 12 individual outputs. Along with full MIDI
Implementation, it's a snap to integrate into your studio. Use it as a
stand-alone desktop drum machine, or hook it up to your MIDI keyboard or
DAW system like a sound module for some serious drums! Sounds can be
arranged for a MIDI keyboard however you please, and the RX5 will save
the keyboard mapping—even if the sounds are coming from an
external sound cartridge.The RX5 was shipped by Yamaha with one additional cartridge of
sounds—the ""RX5 ROM"". Three additional Waveform ROM Cartridges
were made to suit various genres: WRC-02 ""Jazz/Fusion,"" WRC-03 ""Heavy
Metal,"" and WRC-04 ""Effects."" There were also a few third-party
cartridges made, containing TR-808 and TR-909 samples, but they are rather rare. If
you're looking for an RX5, try to find one with all the ROM cartridges,
and maybe a ""RAM4"" cartridge too, as they may  come in handy.Overall, a very unique and in-depth machine, capable of a huge
variety of sounds. From the nostalgic sounds that defined 80's drum
beats, to rock, metal, and electronic music. Programming a beat may not
be as easy as a Roland TR machine, but it's still intuitive tap-based
recording. You will have no problem finding a place for this beast in
your studio.",

patterns can be brought in via ROM cards for the RY30/RM50 as well as
some SY/TG cards.There are digital 12 and 24 db/oct hipass and lowpass filters which
sound ok, and are great for contouring sounds. There are no effects
except internal samples can be played in reverse. It
also has four outputs that you can assign any drum sound to (kick, snare,
hihat, etc). A nice little Modulation Wheel can adjust the pitch, decay

and string sections. The SK-10 was the first of the SK-series,
released in 1979 - the SK-20, 30 and 50D followed in 1980, and the SK-15
in 1981, possibly as a replacement for the SK-10. The SK-10 is the only
one in the series that does not incorporate a synth section, but has
organ, brass and string sections that can all be played together for
more interesting combinations. Very sturdy casing, 4-octave and fully
polyphonic the features also include a leslie simulator, vibrato, attack
and sustain rocker switches, a slider for 'brilliance' and a one-octave
transpose switch. Not exactly feature-laden, but a lovely string synth
sound. Interestingly, they are often referred to as 'analog', but in
fact do have a digital section. Its organ has one of the early
implementations of Yamaha's FM technology in a very limited form,
concurrent with the GS-1/2 development platforms which eventually led to
the DX series.The ORGAN SECTION is available in all the SK series synthesizers. It
offers a full range of stop levers from 1' to 16', percussion levers
with adjustable decay, and controls for overall sustain, brilliance and
decay. This gives you quite a lot to work with in the way of synthesis. 
The organ's sound is FM based and it sounds very B3 like. 
You can add a Vibrato and a noisy but good Tremolo to it. Its sound is
all about the 70's era rock organ, especially with the Ensemble chorus effect
in use. It also has a Leslie-speaker output around back.The PRESET STRINGS section isn't very sophisticated and 
offers very limited editing capabilities. It is the string section though, that is worth aquiring
this keyboard for. Very similar to the best of the string synths, (such
as the Arp Solina/Omni or the Logan String Machine) it has a sound
reminiscent of the opening of 'Oxygene' (J-M Jarre) or the lead line from 'Love Will
Tear Us Apart' (Joy Division). Yamaha SK-20The SK20 adds the
POLY-SYNTH SECTION: a 7-note polyphonic synthesizer with basic filter,
pitch, envelope, and portamento controls. It features two (detuneable)
oscillators per voice so it's good for thick pads. It lacks any bite
whatsoever and, even in normal attack mode, has way too slow an envelope
to be used for any bass or percussion sounds. But, the pads and strings
you can get certainly shine and glitter like Bowie a-la Ziggy Stardust
(especially when layered with the Strings section).
It's like a good entry-level synthesizer. Basic and simple LFO, filters
and ADSR envelopes. It has a built-in sustain and the Tremolo and
Ensemble chorus effect also apply to this section.Yamaha SK-30The SK30 (weighing in at over 90 lbs.) and SK50D also feature a SOLO SYNTHESIZER SECTION which is a
single VCO driven mono-synth similar to a Roland SH-101. It has basic pitch, waveform, filter,
volume, envelope generator and portamento functions. Its resonant filter isn't
great and can't be driven into self-oscillation. The keyboard's
after-touch can control the vibrato, tremolo, and brilliance effects.
You can effectively play leads in the solo section while simultaneously playing
chords in the string, organ or poly-synth sections.Yamaha SK-50DThe SK50D adds the Bass section as well as an additional second
keyboard stacked above the other! The BASS SECTION provides an independent
set of tone generators and controls for a deep, rich organ bass sound.
It has its own set of stop levers, as well as sustain and
brilliance controls.All the different sections of the SK synths can be layered and stacked
via the slider bars. You use the slider bars as a mixer to set the
individual volume for each section. All sections have their own separate
audio outs (though a mix out is also available). A great thing for live
performances is the split keyboard mode. That way you can have, for example, a very
nice, punchy bass sound from the synth section and a lead sound coming
from the organ or solo sections. Although it has no patch memory, there
are push buttons for instantaneous selection of organ, poly-synth and
string preset sounds; there are three presets in each section. It also,
has no arpeggiator or sequencer, and lacks MIDI. But it's cheap, easy to
use, has a nice sound, full 61-note keyboard, and classic wooden panels.
The SK's have been used by The Constantines, DJ Logic, Sigur Ros, and Ben

Filtering external sounds have extremely low output too.The SU10 won't replace your real sampler nor should it be considered a professional sampler but it does have its place. If you can handle the limited sampling specs and very poor filter then the SU10 can still provide you with hours of fun and entertainment, but that's about it.

turntable. There are two real time control knobs assignable to the Loop Remix, Slice, 
Tech Mod (LFO), Distortion/Lo-Fi, Delay, and Filter effects. Loop Remix is a function that
slices up a loop and allows you to effect the slices to create a whole new variation of that loop.A nice feature is a Resampling function which allows you to re-sample your loops or
performances with any effects you may have applied. Sampled loops are also beat-matched
to the tempo automatically using the Loop-Track Play feature, so you can be sure your 
loops will play in time with each other. Sync the SU200 to a tempo via MIDI or use the 
Tap Tempo key (essential for live DJ use). The SU200 also features Line and Mic inputs,
MIDI IN (supports bulk dump of SU10 samples) and SmartMedia Memory Card storage. 
It can be battery powered and it ships with a CD to get you started sampling drum loops and synth loops.

produced by Yamaha. They are single-VCO synthesizers (derived from the
GX-1) with preset sounds and basic
synthesis capabilities. As was the trend during the mid-seventies, the
SY-1 and SY-2 were designed as accessories to the larger organs and
pianos of the time—compact and light enough to sit atop an organ (or
piano) and adorned with controls and switches that imitated those found
on organs. One listen to the SY-1 or SY-2 and you'll hear the signature
classic synth sound that defined Yamaha throughout their more famous
CS-series.There are 28 preset sounds which include woodwind and brass
instruments on the red switches, piano and stringed instruments on the
yellow switches, and stranger synthesized sounds (such as ""Growlpet"") on
the green switches. These preset sounds can not be combined but they can
be freely edited using the sliders and knobs to the left of the compact
37-note keyboard. To facilitate that, there's a great-sounding analog
low pass resonant filter, analog VCA envelope and an attack/pitch-bend
effect. Additional control switches allow for some more tweaks, such as
pulse-width modulation, vibrato, portamento and keyboard transposition.
A Touch Control feature allows for expressive aftertouch control from
the keyboard to be sent to the VCO, VCA or VCF for achieving vibrato,
wah-wah or volume effects, repsectively. While there is obviously no sign of MIDI control (it hadn't been
invented yet), there is also a lack of CV and Gate controls that would
have allowed it to work with other analog equipment. But the compact and
vintage wood road-case design make this a synth for the road, which also
means some units could show signs of decades worth of abuse—an important
consideration when looking at second hand units. Nevertheless, it is a
unique alternative to CS-series Yamaha's that are a fun synth to play
around with and an historic synth to own! The SY-1 has been used by
Royksopp.Yamaha SY-2 (1975)The SY-2 has all the same preset sounds as the SY-1, and adds
enhanced synthesis controls. A resonant high pass filter has been added
alongside the resonant low pass and the VCA envelope
controls have been expanded to full ADSR by adding Decay and Release sliders.
The SY-2 also adds Foot Control (via external input) of Wah-Wah and Volume to
expand expressive control beyond that of the keyboard's Touch Control
feature (the SY-1 had Foot Control for volume only). And lastly, the SY-2
was built in a more rugged flight-case style enclosure. The SY-2 has been
used by Add N To (X) and BBC Radiophonic Workshop and even made
an appearance in Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third
Kind"".",

digital FM synthesis with products like the DX-series. It is an
all-analog mono-synth that came out in 1982 but was never commercially
sold outside of Japan, making it very rare. In fact, it was originally
intended to be an ""educational"" synth to help students learn
about synthesis. However, as most of the controls are labeled in
Japanese characters, you will already need to be familiar with analog
synthesizers (or Japanese) to grasp the SY20.Despite being a rather simplistic looking mono-synth, the SY20 is a
surprisingly refined and expressive synth. There are 20 preset sounds,
arranged in two banks of ten. They include all the customary attempts at
emulating the acoustic sounds of piano, woodwinds, stringed and brass
instruments. The presets can be combined with the manual synthesizer
control sections, which are very simply and logically laid out: VCO,
VCF, and VCA, and each section can be individually switched on or off.
There is an LFO to modulate each of these three sections for pitch,
filter and tremolo effects. There is also Portamento and a one-octave
Transpose knob that is notched in half-tone steps (it can be used to
quickly transpose what you are playing to different keys).The VCO section offers one oscillator with Square and Saw waveforms. A
slider is used to mix between the two waveforms. The oscillator pitch
can be set from 2' to 32'. There is also Pulse-Width modulation and
White Noise. The VCF offers three filter modes: low pass, and two band
pass modes. The filter sounds really good, though it is not
self-oscillating. The typical cutoff and resonance controls are
accompanied by ADSR envelope controls for a nice contoured filter
effect. The VCA section offers the standard ADSR controls as well.While the main synthesis sections are all nicely laid out and straight
forward, the real expressive potential comes from a few other simple but
effective features. The 44-note keyboard supports after touch, which can
be sent to the VCF, the VCA and the LFO for adding filter, volume and
modulation effects using keyboard pressure. They can be combined in any
way and with as much (or little) depth as needed for the desired effect.
There are also three global effects: Portamento, Sustain and Brilliance.The SY20 has a mono audio output, headphone jacks in the front and rear,
and a built-in speaker! Unfortunately there is no CV/Gate and the MIDI
specification was still a year away from being published, so it can not
be hooked up to any sequencing equipment—you're gonna have to play
this one the old-fashioned way.The SY20 has a lot to offer. It sounds really good—warm, pure,
expressive and wholly analog. It is incredibly rare. It is the last
analog synthesizer Yamaha designed before going digital. And it is
covered mostly in Japanese characters. All these qualities combine to
make it an historic and unique piece in any collection and it will definitely get used often, it may
even become the ""go-to"" mono-synth for anybody lucky enough to own one!",

eighties, to AWM and AWM2 synthesis in the nineties, the SY35

Some of them were the module version of the SY-workstations (without keyboard and onboard sequencer).The TG55 is basically a 16-bit sample playback based synth module – perhaps the first one from Yamaha employing this kind of sound generation, other than the old classic FM at DXs and TX modules - which appeared also in the same era like, e.g. the Roland U-220.
This synthesis method used in the TG55 is called AWM2. The name stands for Advanced Wave Memory 2nd generation – it’s essentially Yamaha’s name for the PCM playback. The first original version of AWM had a 12-bit resolution, only the second version became 16-bit.In its 2MB sample ROM, amongst 74 waveforms there are 50 acoustic instruments, 16 drum sounds, 8 digital waveforms – all of them are sampled in 16-bit depth and at 32 or 48 kHz sample rate.The TG55’s sample oscillators are called ""elements"" - each patch consists of 1, 2, or 4 of them. The maximum polyphony is 16 voices.
The factory sounds are those quite typical early nineties, but don’t judge it by only the presets. It has strengths like nice ambient pads, or new-age synths – they can sound crisp and clear. Considering its age, it hasn’t got the most realistic acoustic patches, but in case of deeper programming, this module is really capable of much more. It also has waveform and data expansion card slots for expandability.What’s more, TG55 has 2 digital resonant filters (HP/LP, and LP - both with 12dB/oct), LFO with 3 possibilities (to amplitude, to pitch or to filter cutoff) , 3 Envelope Generators - 5 stages envelope, and 34 programmable digital effects (reverb 8-types, delay, stereo panning delay, gate and distortion) for shaping the sounds further.It has a keyboard workstation brother called SY55 (that lacks the extra pair of individual outputs) released a year later. The TG55's successor, the TG500 had a much larger sample ROM and polyphony two years later. In the family of TG modules, somewhere between the rather tabletop vector-controllable AWM/FM TG33 module, and the flagship TG77 – which is a real monster with its AWM2/AFM capabilities – the TG55 (and later the TG500) is unique using pure AWM2 sound generation method.Nowadays, TG55 may seems a little dated but it’s also a quite underrated 1U module that still can produce interesting sounds. Although it’s a bit difficult to edit with only the onboard buttons, it has extensive voice editing functions. Since TG55s are very solid, well-built constructions, (plenty of them are still working good after more than 25 years) – while they are relatively cheap these days, they can be useful extensions for a synth setup of experimenter musicians.",

FB-01. These featured 4 FM operators per
voice, and 8 voices of polyphony. And like the latter three, 8-parts multitimbrality

more than 15 years old. Supposedly marking Yamaha's entry into
professional rack-mount samplers, the TX16W seems to take its
rack-design from Yamaha's REV-series effects processors. A narrow 2-line
LCD display, numeric keypad and about a dozen other buttons makes for a
lousy sample-editing experience - yet this was how it was done in 1987/88.

eight monophonic outputs, polyphonic stereo out and an external audio input (Mic,
Line) on the front-panel. The original
TX16W's System OS had to be loaded from 720kb disks in non-DOS format,
and frequently needed reloads from the System disk. Moreover this OS is
one of the worst ever made. Alternative: Typhoon 2000, a freeware OS
provides much easier handling, support for RS422 (you can connect it
directly to the built-in MIDI interface of a Mac for SCSI-like
communication), 17 factory filters and support for the AIFF audio format. Typhoon
is a must have to stay healthy while working with this sampler.
It is good for M1-type pianos, percussion sounds, voice samples and your basic 80's style sounds.

it is a rack unit that could take up to eight TF1 modules. A TF1 module is basically
a DX7 condensed down to a single circuit board with almost no front panel controls.
Definitely designed for use with external hardware and software controllers the TX816
allows you to easily carry around up to eight DX7s! Software such as MOTU Unisyn, Emagic SounDiver,
or even another DX7 can be used to program the sounds in each module via MIDI.Each TF1 module consists of a 16-voice, 6-operator digital FM synth engine. So
a complete TX816 with all eight TF1 modules would offer up to 128 voices and 48 operators! Each TF1 also
features an indepednent audio out (XLR) and MIDI I/O for a total of eight audio outputs and MIDI I/O's. It also
has one global MIDI in/out port with 8-part multitimbrality, but no common stereo or mix output. The TX816 was designed for demanding live use where portability, polyphony, and lots of outputs are a must!
The TX816 is fully compatible with all other DX synthesizers including Native Instruments FM7 software-based plug-in.
You can use the TX816 like it's eight seperate DX7s or mix and pan each module together to layer
your sounds into one monsterous DX powerhouse! It has been used by Kitaro, Chick Corea, Michael Jackson, Europe, and Scritti Politti.In the early eighties these sold for anywhere between $2,000 to $5,000 depending on how many
TF1 modules were installed (from two to eight typically). Luckily for today's musicians you
can get a software plug-in like FM7 for ten times less money and you still get everything the TX816

features can be stored as performance setups. The effects are simply
envelope and re-triggering effects. The TX81Z works great as a
sound-module for any live or studio production. It's got a wider range
of sounds than the DX-7, may not be quite as warm or 'classic' sounding,
but at its low price and with the excellent MIDI implementation it makes

it has a full 76-note semi-weighted keyboard and the W7 has a typical 61-note keyboard,
both of which respond to initial-touch (velocity) and aftertouch.The AWM2 tone generation system provides 8 MB of wave memory with 384 realistic voices

choose from preset amplitude types (39), filter settings (59), pitch envelope settings (40)
and LFO settings (33) to quickly punch up and edit various voice parameters. This eliminates
the need to get deep into tedious editing of your sounds from scratch, but the option
to get deep into editing is also there. A large backlit LCD display facilitates easy visual 
programming. There's also a double dial which allows for quick access parameter tweaking.Also onboard are studio quality DSP effects. They can be assigned to individual voices
or they can be used as a global effect over the whole system. There are 3 Insertion Effects
and 3 System Effects available. With a ton of tried and true effects processors to its name,
you can expect these Yamaha effects to be of superb quality and there are enough processors
in the W5 / W7 to provide you with all the sweetening you need!A powerful sequencer is onboard to provide you with the creative flexibility to create
entire songs and performances right from the synth itself, with no need for any other gear!
The sequencer has a 100,000 note capacity. It is a 16-track sequencer and its memory can hold
up to 16 different songs. There is only 32 notes of polyphony, but it should be enough for most
arrangements and performances. Sequences, voices and songs can be stored to an external disk
and as standard MIDI files for archiving. Yamaha released a ""Version 2"" upgrade for all models 
made before 1996 which added more voice banks (P2 and P3). The W-series has since been replaced

hold up to 300 patches, two LFO's, vibrato, and more. It tends to
produce very deep dance/techno basses, eighties digital synth sounds,
and new age sounds.It uses the same synthesis as the TX81Z, which
means it has 8 waveforms to choose from rather than just sinewaves,
which gives it a wide range of possible sounds.The complexity of FM synthesis is somewhat relieved by the ""Easy Edit""
controls for basic editing operations, but this can also be limiting
since not all parameters are accessible. Full editing of the patches
requires a MIDI based patch editor, such as YSEditor, which is available
for free but only for the Atari ST. Fortunately, it works on Atari ST
emulators for the PC. It's worth the trouble because it allows you to
load up your YS with original patches from the TX81Z and some of
Yamaha's other classic 4-operator DX synths, making the YS a good way to
get your hands on classic patches from several keyboards all in one box.Yamaha EOS B200The Yamaha B200 is essentially a YS200 with speakers and a more subdued

and Windows computers. It is a semi-modular synthesizer with the
ability to layer multiple synthesis techniques for really unique
textures, pads, tones, soundscapes, rhythmic effects and other synth
sounds ranging from analog to digital. ABSYNTH was originally released
in 2000 by Rhizomatic Software as an internet download. Native
Instruments saw the potential for ABSYNTH and have taken it to new
heights over the past decade!The latest version, ABSYNTH 5, has an array of new features and
effects (with more than just great names) including the Mutator,
Aetherizer, Cloud Filter, Supercomb Filter, and Filter Feedback along
with an expanded collection of preset sounds. Yet it still retains
much of its older design aspects, such as the semi-modular approach,
three independent oscillators with two filter / modulators per
oscillator, multi-break-point envelopes and custom waveform editing.
One very nice feature of this software synthesizer is that you can
record short 3-minute audio files while in stand-alone mode. This is
good for catching a quick idea or sound to file and later importing it
into another program or even back into ABSYNTH.Upon program launch you are presented with ABSYNTH's sound
library, which comes with over 1,700 sounds! Thankfully, they have
provided a very good browser with categorical filters to narrow the
program list down to help find what you may be looking for. Categories
include instruments, sources, timbres, articulations and genres.
Sounds from Absynth v3 and v4 are included too.ABSYNTH offers several synthesis methods including subtractive
synthesis, FM, wave-table, granular synthesis, ring-mod and sampling
with wave-morphing via three independent oscillators. The oscillators
each have nine different synthesis/sound sources to choose from (one
being an external audio input). The oscillators each have their own
modulation and pitch tune controls to further shape and morph your
sound. Each oscillator is then followed by two Filter / Mod sections -
you can assign two Filters, or 1 Filter + 1 Mod, or two Modulators to
each oscillator, in any order. The Filters offer 16 different types of
filter options (multiple Lowpass, Bandpass, Notch, Supercomb, Comb,
Allpass, and Cloud) with Filter Feedback. The new Supercomb filter
offers fine-adjustable resonance which allows for a much more accurate
acoustic emulation of sounds. The Cloud Filter is like the Aetherizer
effect, it's a grain-based filter/effect that can act on each individual
oscillator. And the Filter Feedback allows for a self-oscillation type
of effect. The Mod section offers three modulation options (Waveshape,
Freq Shift, Ring Mod). After that, to further enhance that beautiful
pad you are making, you can insert two more Master Filter / Mod
sections plus a Master Effect into the chain.Next is the Effects section. ABSYNTH allows you to assign one of
six different effects including Pipe, Multicomb, Multitap, Echoes,
Resonators, and Aetherizer. Each effect allows you to edit its amount,
feedback, velocity, surround, and much more. This is where the new
Aetherizer granular effect can be dialed up, allowing for the
breakdown, manipulation and recombination of your sounds that result
in extremely odd choruses, delays and even vocoder effects (and it can
be applied to external audio too).ABSYNTH offers a Waveform Editor where you can freely draw in your
own waveforms and hear the results in real time. These waveforms can
be used by the oscillators, LFOs, and in the Mod sections as
waveshaping distortion functions. This is a truly unique feature to
ABSYNTH among competing soft-synths. The Waveform Spectrum Editor
allows you to trim individual harmonics for entirely new timbres. And
waveforms can be Transformed using normalization, DC offset, phase
inversion and offset, reverse, fractalize, filter, FM, and more.
Custom waveforms can be saved to the Waves Library for use at any time
and in any ABSYNTH program.ABSYNTH has three discrete LFO's. Each of them can modulate pitch,
amplitude, filter, FM depth, pan or delay time. There is also Sample
and Hold for each LFO for that classic analog synth effect. The LFO's
waveforms can be drawn and edited within the Waveform Editor. There
are plenty of envelopes as well. The graphical Envelope editor allows
you to see and edit your envelopes. They contain up to 68 breakpoints
per envelope so your sound can drone out with multiple decays,
attacks, sustains and other evolving or rhythmic dynamics. You can
create dozens of envelopes and assign them to various modules and
parameters. This allows you to easily and truly sculpt your sounds
like never before! The Envelope Transform Generator allows you to
build tempo driven arpeggiated and percussive rhythms using the
envelopes. The envelopes can be used to shape the amplitude and/or the
pitch, filters, or other synth parameters.Another of the new features that ABSYNTH employs is the Mutator
function. This allows you to easily mutate the sound into a
completely different sound at the click of a single button. You can
define the amount of mutation and how random you want it to get. It
also has a Retry button, which will revert the sound back. It keeps a
history of Mutations for you as well, so if you want to go back to a
previous try, all you have to do is click on it. There is also a
Master Finetuning section, which allows you to change the Volume,
Pitch, Brightness, Bass, Resonance, Distortion, etc. so you can
achieve the ultimate sound desired.Overall, this is an extremely powerful software synthesizer - more
like a musical sound designer than anything else - that is often used
for luscious soundscapes and evolving pads, although ABSYNTH is quite
capable of other synth and drum sounds as well. Practically all
editable parameters can be controlled via mouse or MIDI CC# via 16
assignable Macro Controllers and one X-Y Panner. At home on both Mac
and Windows systems running as a stand-alone, Audio Units, VST, RTAS,
Core Audio, DirectSound and ASIO, ABSYNTH will easily and instantly
integrate into any computer-based set-up.",

percussion software-sampler. Battery can load up to 54 drum, percussion
and sound samples into its ""cells"" in the ""matrix"" section. Each cell
offers a complete set of sound parameters and can use up to 128
velocity-switchable sample layers. This all boils down to a software
sample editor/player with extensive sound shaping options! And it's
available for both Mac and PC.Battery is easy to use and nicely designed. It is fully compatible for
any situation. It functions stand-alone with ASIO, MME, and Sound
Manager and your computer keyboard can trigger drum sounds in real time.
It also functions as a Plug-In using VST 2.0, MAS, DXi, Audio Units,
RTAS, and DirectConnect. This means Battery can be used with all
sequencers from Cubase to Digital Performer and even Pro Tools Mix
systems. In most cases, both MIDI control and direct digital routing of
audio can be handled between these applications seamlessly (provided you
have the CPU power and RAM recommended). Battery functioned beautifully
in concert with Digital Performer 2.7, FreeMidi and MAS for recording
the demo drum loops below. An RTAS (Real Time Audio Suite) version for
Pro Tools is also available as part of the $999 Native Instruments
Studio Collection Pro Tools Edition, which includes Battery, the Pro-52 vintage synth, and the B4 organ. Battery loads most audio formats
including: Akai, SF2, LM4, AIFF, WAV, and MAP. It supports drag-and-drop
for simple and fast loading of samples too.Battery comes with twenty kits to get you going. Load up an entire or
kit, or create your own custom kit, cell by cell. Each cell can be
edited with a variety of features that maximize the full potential of
drum sample programming. A nice graphic AHDSR envelope section shows
just what you're doing to your sample as you tweak it. A cool Pitch
Envelope effect allows you to morph the pitch in time for bendy and
swooshy effects. There's also a sample tune, a dynamics shaper, bit
reduction effect, and Sample Start Adjust point. Each cell has 6
modulation inputs and the modulators are located at the bottom left of
the Battery screen. Use these to further twist or mangle sounds, it
comes with some preset modulation routings too. The FX Loop, also
available to each cell can loop a select portion of the drum sample a
given number of times for creating rhythmic sound effects.Battery is all the drum machine you'll ever need. Provided you use a
sequencer, Battery integrates seamlessly into any studio.* It provides a
software based solution to drum programming. With its easy to use and
unique features, it's easy to get the most out of your drum samples and
have them waiting for you in your sequencer...no need to worry about
keyboard placement of samples or fussing with buttons, LCD-menus,
page-screens, etc. Battery is just as simple as pointing, clicking,
dragging, and dropping. Wide spread availability of samples in
compatible formats, extensive MIDI control, flexibility, and multiple
audio routing options make Battery the perfect source of beats for the
most demanding professionals and entry-level newcomers alike. A must
have for any serious computer-age musicians!* Battery may not load large kits on the Macintosh. When used
stand-alone on the Mac, drum kits too large to load into the available
RAM won't load completely. This problem occurred less frequently when
used as a VST plug-in however.Battery Studio Drums is a library available from Native
Instruments Sound Line ($99) with over 3,000 acoustic drum samples. They
are grouped into 26 kits for Battery and/or Kontakt. These drums were
recorded using many known name brand drums and cymbals for a total of
1.1GB of WAV samples. Since the individual samples are WAV format (24
bit, 44.1kHz), they can be loaded into any sampler you have, hardware or
software. But the kits designed for Battery have brilliantly programmed
velocity layers (up to 16 per drum pad) so that the cymbals and drums
give a completely natural and expressive sound. These drum sounds are
great for Rock, Pop, Jazz, Soul, Funk, Dub, Reggae, and more.Synthetic Drums is a library available from Native Instruments
Sound Line ($99) with over 1,500 synthesized electronic drum samples.
They are grouped into 30 kits for Battery and/or Kontakt. These drums were created by renowned
sound designers and producers of Techno, House, Drum and Bass, IDM,
Electro, Ambient and Hip-Hop. Since the individual samples are WAV
format (24 bit, 44.1kHz), they can be loaded into any sampler you have,
hardware or software. But the kits designed for Battery take full
advantage of it's velocity layers and modulation capabilities. In

The focus of this review will be on Battery's new features, so for a
review and introduction to just what exactly is Battery, check out our
review of the original 2001 version of Battery.The folks at Native Instruments have listened to their users. Battery 2
has a much better interface and enhanced sound quality and shaping
features. It has a new 256 voice polyphonic sampling engine with support
for Direct From Disk streaming. Now you can create massive drum kit
libraries. And speaking of libraries, it ships with a 3.5 GB drum sample
library with 23 kits, as well as updated versions of all Battery 1's
original kits. Battery 2's other major new feature is the optimized and
resizable interface. The window can display from 9 to 72 ""cells"", and
the edit pane is retractable for a stream-lined display.The edit pane is significantly improved in it's layout as well. The left
side has 6 tabbed menus that display the Cell, Mapping, Modulation,
Filter, Compressor, and Loop pages. The right shows the graphic waveform
display with simple volume envelope and pitch controls. In the middle
are four simple knobs to modify the sample's tuning, saturation,
bit-degrade, and sample de-grade. All these edit functions apply to each
cell independently.The compressors are new to Battery 2 as well as the multimode filters
with 15 filter types ranging from 6-pole resonant low-pass to parametric
EQ's, vowel filters and more. Battery's loop features are expanded with
up to four loops per cell and several sliders to adjust each loop. The
Modulation section adds an LFO with saw, triangle, square waveforms and
an additional envelope. There are no surprises in Battery 2's interface,
everything you need to totally reshape each cell is easy to find and
just a click away, and they're all MIDI CC assignable too!Battery is also compatible with just about every sample format, adding
support for Kontakt, Gigasampler, and REX 1
& 2 files (beat-sliced loops). The edit pane can be toggled into the
import pane, from which you can import all kinds of sound formats by
simply dragging and dropping them into a cell. Battery 2 itself is very
compatible, functioning as VST, Audio Units, and RTAS plug-ins and
stand-alone using DXI, ASIO, Core Audio, and DirectSound. It's clear
that for a software synth with uncompromised sound quality and easier
than before editing features and almost universal compatibilities,
Battery 2 is the way to go if you're dedicated to drums and percussion.",

Library of Reaktor sounds. These presets feature awesome drum machines,
effects, samplers + transformers, FM-synths + hybrids, sequenced-synths,
and subtractive-synths; all created by top sound designers.
Dynamo can act as a stand-alone software synth using ASIO, SoundManager,
and DirectSound or as a plug-in using VST-2.0, MAS, MME, and 
DirectConnect for Pro Tools. And it's available for both Mac and PC.When you load a library preset you get its control panel on screen. 
You can edit every parameter available to suit your needs. Editing can be done
on the fly, recorded into your sequences, and Dynamo works with 4CONTROL
for enhanced hands-on real-time control! Although Dynamo gives you access to some
amazing sounds from the Reaktor synth, you do not have the ability to create
your own new modules or synthesizers. A major feature absent from Dynamo is the
ability to select, route and design various synthesizers from some 200 modules
available in Reaktor. You can save your tweaked versions of the library presets however.Because of Reaktor's steep learning-curve, Dynamo offers not only an affordable
but easier to use solution to Reaktor. Dynamo still sounds just as good as Reaktor
but comes at less than half the price! Native Instruments also plans to extend the library of sounds
periodically adding new presets available as free downloads!Anyone interested in software synthesizers should look at Dynamo. Its 32-bit real-time synthesis
offers state of the art emulation of general purpose analog to digital sounds.
It doesn't limit itself to the specific recreation of any one particular vintage instrument and it is
much easier to operate than Reaktor. Download the audio and program demos and see if it's right for you!",

e-pianos was meticulously sampled for a more true-to-life sound than
software emulation can provide. The folks at NI made sure to do the best
job recording and programming these samples to provide you with the best
sounding (and still versatile) e-piano. These full-length samples were
captured at various velocities and also have special release samples for
that authentic vintage feel. All of Elektrik Piano's samples can also be

streaming function is also supported to take the strain off your
computer's RAM while still maintaining ultra-low latency.Using Elektrik Piano simply couldn't be easier. There are over a dozen
patches for each of the four pianos just a mouse-click away. With a simple
and intuitive interface, there are just seven knobs for tweaking. Master tuning,
pan and volume are on the right. The four knobs on the left control
various parameters depending on which patch is selected. Typically
they offer tone controls, tremolo, chorus, delay, reverb, phaser, saturation, and other
simple effects. The settings of these knobs can be saved as ""Performances""

ever! The FM7 is based upon the classic and legendary sounds of FM
synthesis found in Yamaha's DX-series, from the DX7 to the DX200!  
The FM7's brilliant user-interface makes FM synthesis understandable,
and for the first time, visually intuitive. And
since the FM7 can import SysEx patch files, of which thousands can be
downloaded from the internet, you have virtually every Yamaha FM
synthesizer and more available to you in an easy to use and totally
modern software plug-in compatible with every major computer music
program (ASIO, MME, DirectX, SoundManager, VST, DXi, Audio Unit, RTAS, MAS,
DirectConnect)! The FM7 can read all
programs from the original DX7, DX7-II, DX11, TX81Z, TX7, DX21, DX27, DX100, TX802 and it reproduces the
sounds of these machines exactly, if not better!As part of NI's Vintage Line, the FM7 not only recreates the look and sound
of DX-synths, but in many ways it surpasses what those original FM
synthesizers could do. To get you started, it ships with two 128-patch banks of new sounds, a set of
128 DX200 patches, and the factory and some additional presets from the original 
vintage DX7. The FM7 is not just a DX emulator in the form of another software plug-in. 
It is a genuine FM algorithm synthesizer that takes the concept to the next level!
It adds distortion and filter operators, extensive modulation capabilities,
a comprehensive effects section, audio input and much more to the
traditional FM architecture.The FM7 has eight operators, each of which can be selected and graphically
edited on-screen or via MIDI controller. The first six operators (A-F) are modeled 
after the DX-series. Operators are unique to FM synthesis. Each one generates 
a waveform which can be used as a carrier (the sound that is heard) or a modulator
(like the way an LFO is a wave that modulates an audible carrier wave). Whereas the original DX-synths only used sine waves for their
operators, the FM7's operators offer a choice of 32 waveforms from simple sine to
complex TX and formant waves. Additionally, the original FM synthesizers
had 32 preset algorithms for designating and routing which
operators will be carriers and/or modulators. FM7 has a fully programmable
FM matrix in which you can freely adjust the signal routing from one operator to another,
and you can even make the operators modulate themselves in a feedback loop.
The original 32 DX-algorithms can be chosen from the FM Matrix's presets menu.The frequency range, output level, stereo panning, velocity sensitivity,
envelope rates, and amplitude modulation assignments for each operator
are all easily edited on-screen or via MIDI controller in a way no old
DX-synth could ever display! A graphical multi-stage envelope section
borrowed from Absynth allows up to 30
points--that's way more than just the four points of a standard ADSR
envelope. It comes with many preset envelopes, and it can be tempo
synced. The last two operators (X and Z) offer new features not
previously seen on DX-synths. Operator X offers a sophisticated noise
and distortion generator. Operator Y has two multimode resonant filters.The FM7 has a remarkable user-interface. It looks like a DX-synth
with its brown/black color, green and red membrane buttons (that look depressed when clicked on).
There's also a three digit display next to some LCD emulated display screens and a 6-octave 
keyboard. Clicking on the main LCD display toggles through a variety of information such as
the name of the current patch, CPU usage, or current polyphony usage.
There's also a lot of screen space which has allowed NI to give FM synthesis programming
the visual representation it has desperately needed for decades. Creating your
own FM sounds has truly never been this easy! And what's more, an ""Easy"" page
gives you access to 20 sliders for somewhat global but common-place parameters
such as Brightness, ADSR, Detune, LFO and Output settings. A ""Master"" section
provides equally simple control of master input/output levels (yes there is an audio input as well),
Chorus/Delay Effects, and some other overall sound shaping effects.One of FM7's coolest features is its MIDI Learn function...just click on the ""Learn"" membrane button, click on
a parameter that you would like to have controlled by a MIDI controller, then wiggle the
controller knob and voila! You have just assigned a knob or slider on your
MIDI controller to a parameter in FM7! This makes using FM7 with your MIDI controllers 
a snap, for either live or studio use. As a stand-alone application, the
FM7 is a monotimbral instrument. But when used as a VST plug-in, up to 8
instances can be instanciated for multitimbral or ensemble applications.
FM7's ""Pitch"" screen lets you adjust global pitch effects like the portamento
and micro-tuning. The micro-tuning feature lets you adjust each note up or
down a half step. A menu of preset micro-tunings from ""Bagpipes"" to ""West Africa""
shows you the sort of ethnic key scales you can create for your more ethnic sounds!Clean sounding, punchy, and alive! That's how one could describe the world
of sounds FM7 can create. Classic Rhodes and Wurlitzer sounds,
percussive sounds ranging from the acoustic to the digitally industrial, 
synthy basses, leads, pads, strings, bells, drones, pulsing and throbbing effects,
and all kinds of ethnic sounds and effects are all just a click away!

Native Instrument's FM8 continues where its massive predecessor had
stopped. FM8 has an all new user interface and color scheme which looks
nothing like the DX7-inspired interface the FM7 has. It's a powerful FM
software synthesizer (VSTi, DXi, RTAS) which can be used for a wide
range of genres. It has the potential to provide bread 'n butter sounds
like a typical ROMpler would and is thus a synthesizer with the power to
become one of the few software synthesizers you'll ever need. Forget
about the complexity of algorithms found in Yamaha's DX-series and FS1r, FM8 has an FM matrix in which the user
can define any FM path imaginable. Forget about the small two-line
displays of the old days, FM8 has a clean user interface where every
feature is one or two mouse clicks away and about every aspect of FM8
can be assigned to a controller via the MIDI learn button.With multi-segment envelopes, multi-segment scaling curves and an
extensive modulation matrix, FM8 is capable of very detailed sounds
baring an almost human quality and realism. If anything, FM8 is a
synthesizer which invites you back to the era where it was fun and
rewarding to create new sounds from scratch again. Thanks to the many
sound shaping aspects you can change with velocity, aftertouch and other
controllers, FM8 can be exceptionally expressive and musical. Add to
this a vast new effects section and within a minute you'll forget the
FM beasts of yesteryear. FM8 grows on you like a fine wine; the longer
you use it, the more you'll appreciate it. Every now and then you'll
find out it's possible to craft sounds you never thought of as
possible, a unique experience which sound designers thrive on.The IN-operator becomes
effective when FM8 is being used as an effects plug-in (called FM8fx).
Any audio source that's fed into FM8fx can be used as operator output.
It can modulate and be modulated by the FM8fx operators, giving
practically infinite sound shaping possibilities. Evidently, a normal
FM8 instance can (as a whole) modulate an operator in an FM8fx instance.
Simply put: the output of a complete FM8 patch (including its effects!)
can modulate a simple sine wave in an FM8fx instance. Use a sample
player to feed a sample into FM8fx and you'll enter SY77/99
territory.A practical aspect of FM8 is its low CPU usage. On a recent PC,
multiple instances of FM8 together will easily give you hundreds of
voices and tens of effects, which makes it a handy tool for any musical
production. Sounds which FM8 does very well include all sorts of bells
and chromatic percussion, DX pianos, organs, Rhodes, a wide range of
basses, guitars, strings, lively percussion instruments, rich
synthvoxes, classic stringmachines, woodwinds, brass, evolving pads,
synthpads, expressive leads, harsh leads, sound effects, and all with
fine musical expression and control.FM8 is caviar for sound
design gurus, which is something to keep in mind: it's still FM. FM may
not be for everyone, it doesn't have the straightforward design of a
traditional analogue synthesizer or even a basic ROMpler. FM-synthesis
is vast, and demands more efforts before your sound sounds well, and
even more efforts before it sounds musically expressive. Luckily, this
isn't a DX synth with a complex user interface, and even novice users
will discover that the basics of FM8 are not too hard to understand.
From the perspective of the user interface, Native Instruments has done
their job very well.It has been used by Skrillex.",

really a functional tool for the beat savvy musician. Intakt is a swiss
army knife for working with sampled loops and beats, available for Mac
and PC supporting VST, Audio Unit, Core Audio, RTAS, DXi, Direct Sound and ASIO formats.
Intakt is based on the Kontakt sampling engine, offering up to 128
stereo voices with 32 bit processing and up to 96 kHz sample rate support.
It even supports Direct from Disk playback.Similar to apps like ReCycle, use it to tempo match any stereo loop on-the-fly,
or chop, morph, effect and twist loops into your own sonic creations all
from a convenient one-screen interface plug-in within your host music
production software! It imports almost any sound format including WAV,
AIFF, REX1 and REX2 files, Gigasampler, AKAI, HAlion, EXS, BATTERY, and
KONTAKT instruments.Intakt offers three types of sampler in one: Beat Machine, Time
Machine, and Sampler Mode. Beat Machine, like ReCycle, uses a
peak-detection algorithm to find the peaks in imported audio loops and
splice them at those points. Each slice can be individually edited for
pitch, playback direction, pitch envelope, amp envelope, distortion,
delay, and more. Each slice is automatically assigned to keys on the
keyboard too. It can then export a MIDI file of the chopped loop for use
in a sequencer. Slices can be muted and re-arranged from within Intakt itself
as well as from the exported MIDI file data. Each slice marker can also
be adjusted if needed, and there's a sensitivity slider to tweak the
number of slice points in the sample.The Time Machine offers time stretching/compressing in real-time without
affecting its pitch. This mode allows you to match any loop to a new
tempo without the need to slice up the sample. This mode is similar to how
apps like Ableton Live work with loops, letting you drop them into your groove asap
and without affecting their original pitch. Of course the sample can be pitched
shifted up or down independent of the amount of time-stretching for
getting that sample in key as well as time with your sequence.Sampler Mode allows you to use Intakt like a typical sampler, assigning
loops and imported samples to each key or across keyboard zones. 
Any time stretching done here will also affect the pitch, just like in
a traditional sampler. This mode is more like a 'lite' version of Kontakt
and is useful for tasks such as mapping each drum of an entire drum kit
across the keyboard.Intakt allows you to shape and mangle your sounds via multi-mode filters
(six types of filtering), two syncable LFOs (with multiple waveforms),
lo-fi effects, syncable delay, distortion and flexible envelopes.
The virtual built-in keyboard shows where samples are mapped and 
features pitch and modulation wheels, transposition and hold (latch) switches.
Intakt ships with a 1.3 GB library of loops from Zero-G and East West covering a broad
range of pop, hip-hop, house, R n B, soul, rock, garage, funk and many
electronic styles.The interface is technical, busy, stream-lined, and takes some getting
used to. But it's laid out quite well, with a Source Edit section where you
work directly with the sample. The Modulation section is basically
envelopes and LFOs for giving the sample some activity. The Effects
section has the filters, delays, etc. for coloring the sample. There's
the keyboard section where you can map and assign samples to any key or
range of keys. Finally a Browser section is built-in for finding and
loading audio from disk, CD, DVD, etc. If you rely on loops in making
your music, Intakt is as professional and musical a tool you'll find for
getting your grooves on!",

Kontakt, but streamlined for ease of use and
functionality. It's designed for users who have library's of sampled
sounds and instruments that you just call up and play, without all the
hassle of creating, editing, mapping and layering individual samples to
create an instrument. Kompakt supports all major sample library formats
(KONTAKT, GigaSampler, HALion, EXS, AKAI, and more) and ships with over
200 professional instruments and sounds like pianos, basses, loops,
drums, guitars, strings, choirs, brass, percussion, leads, pads, basses,
and more. Available for Mac and PC it supports all major formats (ASIO,
Core Audio, SoundManager, VST-2.0, Audio Units, RTAS, DXiII, MME, and Direct Sound).Kompakt may be the quickest and coolest way to build a production-ready
instrument collection. Instruments are loaded into a virtual rack with
space for up to eight simultaneous instruments, so you can switch between
different instruments on-the-fly without having to re-load instruments.
Each instrument can have its own MIDI settings and individual outputs.
Instruments can also be split and layered across the keyboard for
interesting multi-instrument combinations. An integrated browser with
full drag and drop support is built-in for easily finding and loading
samples & libraries.The eight-part multitimbrality and 256-voice polyphony offer plenty of
room to be an entire band with a single instance of Kompakt! It also
lets you reshape your sample instruments much like a synthesizer. It
offers six filter types, three envelopes, and four LFOs so you can still
tweak out the sounds. Stereo effects including reverb, chorus, and delay
are also offered to liven' up your sounds. All instrument parameters can
be accessed and adjusted right from the front panel of Kompakt as well
as MIDI controllers (with MIDI Learn function).Other features include adjustable velocity control for each instrument,
portamento (glide), various microtuning options, Master Filter
section with low pass, high pass, band pass and 3-band EQ, and Direct-From-Disk
streaming (sample is streamed from disk rather than loaded into RAM).
Having Kompakt in your computer is like having a powerful synthesizer
hungry to bring any sample-libraries you have to life. Why spend big bucks on
a Gigasampler when you can get Kompakt for less than $200? ",

Instruments have been leaders in the production of software
synthesizer plug-ins for some time now. With the release of software
samplers such as IK Multimedia SampleTank
and Steinberg HALion, NI offers KONTAKT - the
ultimate sampler plug-in for your computer! KONTAKT works on both Mac and PC
platforms in Stand-Alone or plug-in compatible applications, supporting
ASIO 2.0, DirectSound, MME, SoundManager, VST 2.0, Audio Units, Core Audio, RTAS, DXi, DirectConnect,
and MAS/FreeMIDI formats.KONTAKT comes with five CD's full of samples ranging from basic drums,
guitar, piano, bass, and samples from each of NI's own line of
outstanding  synth plug-ins to get you started. At the left of KONTAKT's
window is a file browser for searching your disks for samples to drag
and drop into KONTAKT's editing windows. Samples are loaded entirely
into available RAM which means if you want to use a 200 MB sample, you
need at least 200 MB of RAM available to KONTAKT. This is not like
HALion which loads only the attack of a sample into RAM and streams the
rest from hard disk. The result is KONTAKT has a heavy RAM requirement
but is guaranteed to have quick and responsive playback of your samples
with no clicks, errors or audible latency.When you open KONTAKT you have an empty 'instance' which can support up
to 16 instruments. Each instrument can be assigned to any MIDI channel.
They each have their own key range, velocity range, and polyphony
settings. It also displays the instrument name and RAM usage with global
Tune, Pan, Solo, Mute and Volume controls. Samples can be freely
assigned to key and velocity zones in the Mapping editor by simple drag
and drop. Samples can also be layered over the same keys or at various
velocity zones on the same key. Crossfades between samples assigned to
neighboring keys or velocity crossfades can be set automatically with a
drop-down menu or manually with small handles in the Mapping editor. 
The Loop Editor lets you quickly and easily assign in/out points for up to 8
different loops per sample. Multiple loops lets you create stuttering
effects and other wacky stuff. There's a Zero-X mode for tweaking the
loop's crossfade point, auto-find loop start/end points, resynthesis and
timestretching functions.KONTAKT has a lot of tricks available to mangle samples into something
new. It operates in one of three modes: Sampler, Tone Machine or Time
Machine. Sampler mode is the basic mode where your intent is to
play-back samples such as those from libraries. KONTAKT supports Akai
S1000 and S3000, SoundFont2, GigaStudio, HALion, EXS24, SND, WAV, SDII,
AIFF, and NI Battery files. Tuning and Reverse can be used to alter the
source sample. The Tone and Time Machines offer interesting sample
mangling features based on granular resynthesis. The Time Machine does
real-time time stretching and pitch shifting. Assign a sample to a range
of keys, for example, and each key can play the sample at a different
tempo but maintain the same pitch. Tone Machine gives the sample the
pitch of any key played. The Granular Synthesis process here can yield
some strange results too.KONTAKT offers a bunch of lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and notch filters
with 6 to 36 dB/oct slopes and resonance, and they sound great. There's
also 1-, 2-, and 3-band EQ's, a phaser, and two vocal formant filters.
Nearly every parameter of KONTAKT can be modulated from sources like the
LFOs, envelopes, step modulators, envelope followers and controllers.
All relevant modulators can be synchronized to MIDI clock. Control- or
right-click on any control or knob to assign a modulation source or MIDI 
controller number to it. You can even assign several knobs to the
same controller. And it can 'learn' an incoming MIDI controller number
from your MIDI controller for quickly and easily assigning knobs on your
controller to the parameters of your choice. KONTAKT also offers three
types of envelopes: a DBD (Decay 1, Breakpoint, Decay 2) for pitch
sweeps, a basic AHDSR envelope, and a flexible 32 point envelope as seen
in Absynth and FM7
(pictured below), which allows you to create very rhythmic and looped
effects. The cool Step Modulator is an analog style sequencer with up to
32 steps and is used to rhythmically modulate any modulatable
destination like the filter cutoff, pitch, etc.In addition there are insert and send effects for each instrument which
include EQ, reverb, chorus, delay, lowfi, stereo enhancer, distortion,
flanger, phaser, compressor, chorus, or any of KONTAKT's 14 filters. The
File Browser window can also be switched to a structure view, in which
all the actual modules, zones, groups, instruments, etc. that are being
used by the sampler appear so you can easily navigate your way around
all he modules in your instrument. And each plug-in instance can support
up to 32 outputs in supporting host applications, and 16 outputs in
stand-alone mode with an appropriate soundcard.As of this writing, KONTAKT is yet another leading plug-in from Native
Instruments! It offers superior sample manipulation with synth-like
filtering and modulation that goes beyond what other soft- and hard-ware
samplers offer. The user interface is awkward and takes getting used to,
but it is very streamlined, efficient, and everything is done
graphically within one window. The samples that come with KONTAKT
(developed by Yellow Tools) are not the greatest but show you how
realistic and creative you can get with sample mapping, layering,
modulating, etc. If you were looking to go virtual with your studio,
KONTAKT is the affordable sampler that will replace your hardware
sampler!Famous user BT says,
""Kontakt is the most comprehensive and elaborate sample engine I've ever
worked with. The only software sampler you'll ever need."" Paul Hartnoll
of Orbital says ""Kontakt is
the best software sampler that we have ever seen, very simple and easy
to use. Yet with it's modular structure it can be as complex as you
want. It's an incredible creative device...""",

MASSIVE. This is a powerful synthesizer with a lot of potential and
flexibility under an otherwise simplified and intuitive hood. There
are only three different pages to view in this program. ""Synth"" view
shows all the parameters and knobs that are needed to create and edit
sounds in a single, concise and well conceived page. ""Attribute"" view
allows you to add meta-data attributes to the selected patch - from
author name to categorical information - for use in the KoreSound
Browser. The ""Browser"" page is where you can choose from any of the
600 preset sounds, or your own creations, with a helpful
category-based filtering system where you select certain attributes to
narrow down the program list in hopes of finding the right sounds for
your needs. Both the Attributes and Browser pages include a Macro
Control section with eight assignable knobs for immediate
fine-tweaking.Now this is the question you're probably asking yourself: what
about the synth itself? MASSIVE is a 16-voice polyphonic synthesizer
that is based on a unique Wave Scanning algorithm, implemented via
three parallel oscillator modules, two multimode filters with
fantastic routing options, and a number of modulation sections that
include step sequencers and easy to use dynamic envelopes.MASSIVE comes with three independent oscillators that provide 85
different wavetables to select from, categorized as Basic,
Analog/Electric, Digital/Hybrid, FX/Chords and Virtual Analog. It also
allows five different time/frequency shifting options to further
change the timbre of the selected wavetable. Each oscillator has its
own Pitch control, Wavetable-position, Intensity, and Amp (level)
knobs. A wonderful thing about MASSIVE is that each knob can be
assigned to control a secondary parameter - they are easily routed by
dragging any envelope, LFO or Macro Control (look for the moveable object icons) to the
boxes underneath a given knob. Click & drag on the value in the
box to adjust that parameter, or simply tweak the knob itself to
adjust both the knob's default parameter and the newly assigned
parameter together.There is also a Modulation Oscillator section that allows you to
vary the main oscillators' signal with Ring Mod, Phaser, Position,
and Filter FM modes. You can independently assign any of these modes
to each of the oscillators. It also has its own pitch control. There
is also a Noise generator with 12 different noise types to choose from
with knobs to change the Color and Amp (level) of the noise. Next-door
to that is the Feedback control. You can easily dial in feedback into
any patch to amplify, dirty or even distort it. There is a warning in
the manual stating that too much feedback can damage speakers and
hearing!There are two Filters available. DJ-style sliders beside each
oscillator section let you adjust, or mix, how much of each oscillator
you want to send to Filter 1 and Filter 2. A similar slider beside the
Filter sections allows you to mix between series or parallel modes for
the two filters. Each filter has 12 different filter types to choose
from, along with three control knobs that vary from cutoff and
resonance to Pitch and Feedback, depending on the type of filter mode
selected. All the usual suspects including Lowpass, Highpass and
Bandpass are on tap, as well as some new modes like Acid and
Scream.There are two master effects sections, plus an additional two
insert effects sections. The master effects have 17 different effects
you can use ranging from reverb, chorus, delay, and flanger to tube
amps. There is also a master 4-band equalizer section which can be
added to sweeten the whole patch.MASSIVE also has a centrally located tabbed-window section which
allows for the editing of four separate envelopes and up to four
LFO's or 16-step sequencers. The envelopes are very sophisticated,
parts of the envelope can be looped and you can morph between
different transitions or crossfades for the defined loop start and end
points. There are a few preset envelopes to load, as well as the
ability to store and load custom user envelopes. The same can be said
of the LFO's, with basic waveforms to complex waveforms that can be
edited and then saved for use later. There are two types of 16-step
sequencers as well: Stepper and Performance. While the Stepper
conforms to the well-known, established operating modes, the Performer
allows each step to be shaped individually, making it ideal for
advanced rhythmic structures.Also tucked away within this center panel of MASSIVE are the
various global settings pages. These allow you to set up and/or adjust
everything from oscillator glide and portamento, pitch-bend range,
vibrato, key-tracking (to map incoming pitch information generated by
your keyboard or sequencer individually for each oscillator and
filter), voicing settings (unison or polyphony modes), extensive
signal routing options and much more.Overall, MASSIVE is a very powerful software synthesizer that
should belong in any artist's software arsenal. It's a very broad
instrument capable of making nice leads and very good basses. It's
designed to seamlessly integrate with Native Instruments KORE program
as well. Best of all, it provides users with all of Native
Instruments' synthesis quality and experience in one of their easiest
to use platforms yet! MASSIVE Expansion Volumes 1 & 2 each provide
200 additional sounds to its library. MASSIVE has been used by
Assemblage 23, Depeche Mode and Andrew Phillpott.",

reached the next step in its evolution with this
update to the Pro-Five, dubbed the
Pro-52 model. The Pro-Five was a wonderful virtual recreation of
the original Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. But the newew Pro-52 added many new
features that made it an indispensable tool for any computer musician,
offering some of the best and most compatible vintage synth sounds to modern
musicians.A new effects unit was added to the Pro-52 with echo, chorus and
flanging effects. The Pro-52 could also be used as a stand-alone
application and was no longer tied to the VST studio (though it still
acts as a VST instrument seamlessly in any VST 2.0 or better system).
The Pro-52 is able to import Prophet-5 SysEx sound data which means it
can read and accurately reproduce all the existing sound libraries made
for the original and allows your old P-5 sounds to be brought under the
control of the very stable, reliable and clean digital domain. There's
also an audio input capability for processing external sounds through
its filters.Unlike the original classic P-5, the Pro-52 offered unlimited polyphony,
many times more preset memories, velocity sensitivity, MIDI automation
of all available parameters and the option to run several Pro-52's in
parallel. The Pro-53 was an updated version (late 2002)
of the Pro-52 which added many new features and was also compatible with more
Mac and PC audio interface formats including ASIO, DirectSound, MME,
SoundManager, VST 2.0, DXi, DirectConnect, MAS/FreeMidi.",

emulators to a whole new level with improved features and sound! The
Pro-53 is the third installment from N.I. of the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 analog synth plug-in. The original
Pro-Five, a VST-Instrument, was a faithful
recreation of the original Prophet 5 and allowed thousands of
computer-based musicians the chance at playing and performing the
classic synth themselves, and for just a few hundred bucks! Following
the Pro-Five came the Pro-52 which added many
features bringing the plug-in up to date with more modern functions like
effects, enhanced MIDI (SysEx import/export), audio inputs, and stand
alone capability.The Pro-53 is the next version, released in late 2002. It added many new
exciting features. It added the all-important MIDI-learn function which
lets you quickly and easily assign control knobs, sliders, etc. on your
synth controllers to any of the parameters available from the front
panel display of the Pro-53. The Pro-53 was also compatible with all
major Mac and PC audio interface formats of the time (ASIO, DirectSound, MME,
SoundManager, VST 2.0, Audio units, RTAS,  DXi, DirectConnect, MAS/FreeMidi). There's also a
re-designed oscillator technology giving the Pro-53 a punchy, warmer,
and more dynamic sound. For a virtual instrument, it sounds very organic
and is much more stable and cleaner than the original Prophet 5's aging
analog circuits. The Pro-53 interface has been spruced up as well,
adding larger knobs and few new ones too.The filter has new features including a switch to invert the filter
envelopes, and a new high-pass filter. There was a new
LFO-Envelope-Retrigger function which retriggers the envelope with each
new cycle of the LFO wave for interesting animated and colorful sounds.
The Amplifier section featured a new Hold button which latches any notes
played so you can free up your hands to tweak sounds while hearing their
effects in real-time. Linear and circular knob control modes allow you
to customize the Pro-53 to your ergonomic preference. In linear mode the
mouse moves up or down to adjust the knobs; in circular mode the white
notch on the knob follows the mouse as you drag it around the knob,
clockwise to increase and counter-clockwise to decrease it. The NI logo
is actually a pull-down menu holding most valuable functions including
the MIDI Learn mode, controllermaps, microtuning settings, and other
plug-in settings. It has been used by Hans Zimmer.
Although Native Instruments has discontinued the Pro-53, its sound sets, patches, etc. are
still available from NI's user database.",

However, aside from an ultra-clean, crisp and clear new sound the Pro-Five added
unlimited polyphony and memory! And for a more authentic Prophet sound you can choose
the Analog Warmth mode for a little warmth and noise, or use it in Digital Accuracy
mode, either way it sounded great!Velocity sensitivity, real-time MIDI control and automation
of every parameter plus the option to run several Pro-Five's in parallel and all

very flexible and great sounding software-based modular real-time
synthesizer, sampler and effects processor. Select from a large library
of synths/samplers or build and create your own! It functions just as
any other Modular Dream machine would except that in its software
environment, there are virtually unlimited amounts of flexibility,
patchability and sonic possibilities. But prepare for a steep learning
curve if you don't already know a lot about how synthesizers use
oscillators, filters, envelopes, effects, LFOs and so much more to
generate sounds.The Panel layouts of most modules are straight forward and offer a lot
of functionality, but the greatest challenge is in patching and building
these modules. Not only do you patch modules, but you create, add and
assign knobs and buttons to control the various parameters of the module
(can you say, tedious?). Even the real-time Midi controllers have to be
assigned. Of course Reaktor comes with plenty of preset patches to play
with and get you going, and storage of your own creations is virtually
limitless! As usual with software synthesizers, the bigger and better
your Windows or Macintosh computer is, the better Reaktor will perform,
with almost no Midi-audio latency issues on computers over 200MHz and
with well over 100MB RAM.Reaktor is all about modules. Just about any imaginable oscillator
including FM-synthesis and osc-syncing are available. Synthesis is
handled by the Generator component of Reaktor. Synthesis methods include
analog modeling, FM, sample-playback and granular hybrid. The other
major component to Reaktor is the Transformator, a sample player. Though
it isn't a full-featured sampler it offers all the basic editing needs
including some cool time-shift, resampling and key mapping functions.
Sounds are loaded from libraries and can be traded with other Reaktor
users over the internet. Still, it seems this sampler is there just for
kicks when you compare it to the capabilities of the Generator synth
section!For its price, Reaktor offers almost unlimited synthesis potential at a
steal of a price! But the complexity involved even in creating the
simplest patch may limit it to synth Programmers with PhDs, who enjoy
tediously creating and assigning each knob within a module and then
patching together various modules. Using Reaktor can be very challenging
and very rewarding, but unless you have a lot of free time to tinker
with it or you just want to learn the intricacies of signal-flow
concepts and logic of synthesis, it may just overwhelm you. In other
words, if you had trouble using ReBirth, don't
even think about tackling Reaktor! But for that professional synthesist
out there, you're sure to fall in love with the synthesis power of
Reaktor! Demo sounds and Plug-In demos and updates are available from Native
Instruments.REAKTOR 3 offers optimized performance, a redesigned user
interface and many new functions and modules. Drag-and-drop capabilities
have been added, as well as selectable background colors with decoration
bitmap integration and an extended interface for the handling of
snapshots. REAKTOR 3.0 supports the DirectX plug-in interface. The new
tape decks are capable of reading audio files directly from and writing
them directly to disk. MP3 files may be loaded and played as well. Akai
samples can be read directly from CD. REAKTOR 4 adds support for
Mac OS X and Windows XP, Audio Units, CoreAudio and CoreMidi. Automation
of ALL parameters is enabled in v.4 as well as sample mapping technology
borrowed from Kontakt. Reaktor 4 allows for
32-bit samples to be used, there's a new granular delay effect, and an
anti-aliasing feature for the oscillators (borrowed from the Pro-53) to give Reaktor even more realistic synth
emulation capabilities. There's even a whole new Library in v.4 that
takes advantage of these new features.Reaktor has been used by Juno

effect of vocoding to an entirely new level. All vocoders analyze
incoming sound by separating it into frequency bands (sort of like a
graphic EQ) and processing each freq. band independently. One of the
most famous vintage vocoders, the Roland VP330, had just 10 bands.
Vokator has 1,024 frequency bands! This gives Vokator unprecedented
control and smoother sounding results that take the vocoding effect into
realms the vintage gear never could go. And you can adjust the number of
bands (from 4 to 1,024) per patch if you want to go for the older more
vintage sound.Vokator is compatible with all major plug-in formats running stand-alone
via ASIO, Sound Manager, and Core Audio, or as a plug-in using VST 2.0,
MAS, DXi, RTAS, and Audio Units. It's interface is very technical and
takes some getting used to, but once you've gotten into it, it's pretty
easy and well laid out.A Blurb About Vocoders:
""A vocoder aims to replace the carrier of your voice with another
carrier from another source. Thus, it changes the sound of the voice 
but not the message when you speak. It takes formant and carrier from 
external sources and splits them up in bands (a band is a region of
frequencies, same thing an equalizer does). Then, the envelope (the
modulation) is extracted from each formant band. This part is done by an
envelope follower, an extreme low pass filter.  Next, formant bands are
modulated onto the carrier bands and the resulting bands are mixed
together to the output signal... You usually use a human voice as the
formant and an instrument as the carrier. It makes the instrument speak.
Good results can be achieved with strings, brasses, flutes or any other
sound with nearly constant dynamic. Even chords may be used to give the
result more depth.""*Vokator has two channels (A and B), both of which can act as carriers
and modulators. Channel A can play back an audio file (WAV/AIFF) or accept external
audio. Channel B provides another external input, a full-featured
synthesizer, and a granular sampler with time-compression capabilities.
So you can vocode just about anything with ease and right from within
your host music or sound design software environments. Input sounds can 
be processed with gate and level compression, delay
and spectral effects, and more.There basically five vocoding modes available. A*B mode is standard
vocoding where channel A's information is applied to the spectral envelope
from channel B. B*A mode applies channel B onto channel A.
A+B mode does no vocoding, only mixes the two channel's together at the output.
Mix mode lets you mix and pan the A*B, B*A, A+B, and original sound material
all together as desired. Group mode simply lets you group frequency bands
together, essentially reducing the number of frequency bands for 
exploring other sonic possibilities or achieving a more classic vocoder sound.The built-in synthesizer is a dual oscillator design with multiple
filter modes and FM synthesis that can also morph between presets via
the Mod Wheel. The waveforms of both oscillators can be smoothly faded between sine,
triangle, square and noise. Oscillator 2 can be frequency modulated by oscillator 1, and both
oscillators can be ring modulated.The granular sampler basically takes an audio file (WAV/AIFF) and
lets you do time-stretching and/or pitch shifting totally independent of
one another, allowing you to easily get that sample in tempo and in key!
It can also modulate start times, loop parameters, etc. A full range of
modulators, step sequencers, envelope followers, LFOs, and more can be
easily routed to any of the synthesizer's or sampler's parameters.Vokator's virtual keyboard section adds programmable chord memory
and a polyphonic arpeggiator. Vokator ships with over 400 presets
to get you started. In all, Vokator is a very professional Vocoder
designed for the software based musician. It's a great way
to get that classic vocoder effect, but it's even better at designing,
morphing, and creating your own other-worldly sounds. ",

It has an impressive feature set including 3 digital oscillators per voice, 2 filters (each oscillator can be fed into one or both filters), a string filter (for producing more natural instrument sounds, like plucked strings, violin sounds, etc), 4 FX-busses, a 32-step sequencer per part (up to 8 parts after installing one voice expansion), a programmable arpeggiator per part, a dedicated EQ section, 6 envelope generators, 4 LFOs, a large mod-matrix, and more! Adding just one expansion gives you access to a really nice 61-note organ module as well.If you were expecting the Accelerator to be a polyphonic version of the hybrid synth in the Spectralis, you’d be mistaken (though you’d be far from disappointed). The oscillators do share some similarities. Both use continuously variable oscillators that can be modified by Time Linearity Modulation (TLM, which is basically PWM for all waveforms), as well as by phase modulation, ring modulation, and sync. The two, at least to my ears, sound a bit different, but I can’t say I like how one sounds over the other.The Accelerator has two digital multimode filters per voice (12 or 24dB LP, HP, BP, and notch) that can be configured as serial or in parallel. There doesn’t seem to be any audible stepping when cutoff or resonance is manipulated, which is a relief considering that even some analog filters can suffer from this. The string filter should not be overlooked either because it allows you to create sounds resembling musical instruments such as violin sounds, plucked strings, woodwinds, and more. There are a few audio demonstrations online that showcase some of the sounds created using this filter.The Accelerator has a large effects section that is extremely useful when developing your sounds. You can add distortion, mod delay, phasing, Leslie simulation, chorus, and reverb. As an added bonus, you can save FX settings independently if you’d like to recall those settings when working on other sounds!The Accelerator does have a step sequencer per part, which resembles the step sequencers in the Spectralis. Both have step sequencers with adjustable step length per part, which can help create some very dynamic, polyrhythmic sequences. Steps can be skipped or muted and the direction can be changed (and even set to random). The Accelerator has up to 32 steps, the Spectralis has up to 192. An improvement in the Accelerator is that you scroll through the 32 steps in 8-step increments using the keyboard to get you to where you’d like. The Spectralis, on the other hand, requires that you scroll through your sequence 1 step at a time, which can be difficult to manage when you’re using 192 steps (though this is not true of the drum sequencer in the Spectralis)! Another major advantage of the Accelerator over the Spectralis is that each step can be polyphonic. However, the Accelerator was not intended to be a sequencer the same way the Spectralis is. It is difficult to change patterns at the start of a new sequence (though sequences can be saved and recalled later), thus making entire songs with the Accelerator using its sequencer would be a difficult feat (it is first and foremost a synthesizer).The Accelerator has a dedicated sound selection panel off to the right of the LCD display (the display color can be modified). This section is good for picking types of sound quicker than if using a screen to find the patch. One particularly useful feature of this section is the ‘random’ button. Patches can be made based on similar sounds within a particular group of sounds (bass, leads, pads, fx, drums, etc, each of which is a group of sounds). I find myself using this feature quite often because the Accelerator ends up creating some very good sounds.The sounds themselves can be edited by a matrix system, which is straightforward to use. You can modify 8 parameters in each section (oscillators 1, 2, and 3; Filter 1 and 2; Amp; LFOs 1-3; and a User section for your own additions) As much as a ton of knobs would have been a nice addition, editing on the Accelerator takes minimal effort to get used to. There is a nice menu that is easy to navigate for doing more in-depth editing as well.Speaking of in-depth editing, one feature that stands out is the extensive Mod Matrix system, which you can use to help create incredibly complex, evolving sounds. The Accelerator allows you to choose up to 32 slots for 50 sources and 91 destinations for each part, with an extra 6 global mod sources/destinations. You can even use modulation depth from one slot as a modulation source for another!An interesting aspect of the Accelerator is that it contains an internal accelerometer. You can set up changes in the X or Y direction as a source in the mod matrix and use something like filter cutoff or pitch as a destination and then move the Accelerator around to alter the sound. While the Accelerator may seem too big for such a feat, you should realize that it’s much lighter than many 61-key synthesizers, but still well-built. It weighs about the same as my Access Virus TI Polar (a 37-key synthesizer). Is this feature gimmicky? Well, that’s definitely an opinion but, if you think about it, you don’t actually NEED to lift the synthesizer to utilize the accelerometer. It is sensitive enough that you can tap/drum on the side of the synth to use it for rhythmic changes in the sound, as one example of its use in a live performance. Plus, the Accelerator is built well enough to withstand that type of abuse (but don’t go using drumsticks on it, you’ll probably damage
the wood side panels!).If you can, you should visit the Radikal Technologies forum to see what some of the users are saying about it! The Accelerator is updated fairly regularly and there are currently no glaring bugs in the OS that reduces its functionality (that I’m aware of). The Accelerator has a lot of features that could not be covered in this review. Hopefully you will have a chance to discover what a great synthesizer it is for yourself.",

Contained within is a powerful monophonic hybrid synthesizer (the Asynth) composed of 4 digital oscillators that can pass through two analog filters (a 4-pole 24dB LP filter and a 2-pole 12dB multi-mode filter), a 32 stereo voice polyphonic multisampling sound engine (the Dsynth) that pass through a digital 12dB multi-mode filter, an 8 bandpass fixed filterbank a plethora of LFOs to modulate parameters, two delay effects, and an extremely complex and powerful pattern-based sequencer section to sequence internal sounds and parameters as well as external gear. The Spectralis has 32 available songs, each with 32 patterns available. The 4 digital oscillators in the Asynth can be shaped continuously from a sine wave to a square wave, as well as FM, PM, oscillator sync, and bit reduction. Each oscillator can be modulated using something called time linearity modulation, which is a fancy way of describing pulse-width modulation (though in this case, any waveform can be modulated, not just a square wave).The oscillators, analog filters, and filterbank can be independently triggered by 3 Trigger Groups (TGs). Each TG can be sequenced independently using the sequencer. Here is an example: Oscillator 1 and the 24dB filter are triggered using TG1, Oscillator 2 and 3 and the 12dB filter are triggered using TG2, and Oscillator 4 and the filterbank are triggered using TG3. Now each of these TGs can be activated independently on the sequencer, allowing the user to sequence three different monophonic synth parts! This may seem confusing, but there are tutorials online that go through explaining this in greater detail. The manual also has a lesson through which the user can learn how to sequence trigger groups. Trigger groups are likely one of the least understood and most powerful features of the Spectralis.There are 3 independent Dsynth parts (3 part multi-timbral), through which the user can load 3 different sounds and sequence them using the sequencer or by real-time playing of a polyphonic motif. Up to 128 mb of samples can be loaded into RAM at one time. The Spectralis allows the user to import any sampled sound. The process is fairly straightforward on PCs with the importing program, allowing the import of .wav and soundfont2 files. For those using a Mac, a user on the Radikal Technologies forum has made it possible to import and create multisamples using a program called Swami. Each Dsynth timbre can be independently routed into the analog section, whereby they can be directed into either of the analog filter or the fixed filterbank.There are two sequencers in the Spectralis. The drum matrix provides a simple xOx style programming whereby 11 different sampled drum sounds can be sequenced independently. The other step-sequencer is much more powerful, allowing the user to create 24 sequencer-lines that can be set to target internal functions as well as sequence external gear. Internal functions include sequencing trigger groups, analog filter cutoff and resonance, LFO parameters, each filterbank bandpass (which can be used to create interesting rhythmic parts), pitched drum parts, and dsynth parts. Each sequencer line can be set to lengths from 1 to 192 steps and different resolutions (the length of each step), set to play in various ways (forward, backward, forward then backward and vice versa, and random), and each step can be muted, pitched, and set to different probabilities of playing. The Spectralis 2, an updated Spectralis, was created in 2009 that is very similar to the mk1 Spectralis, but includes a 4gb internal compact flash for storage of more sounds. There is also an updated OS (1.5), currently available on only the Spectralis 2 that fixed some known bugs and implemented PERFORMZ folders, which allows users to create new folders that allow 32 new songs with 32 patterns each. Users can then place specific sounds available only in this particular folder that could load on startup and make it easier to switch songs during a live session. Another additional feature implemented is pattern changes via program changes. Some limitations do exist on the Spectralis however. There is no overdub feature when recording live, LFOs cannot be set to time (a work-around does exist for this), sequencer-lines cannot be muted or copied, some options are still on the menu but crash the Spectralis when used, some options are not yet implemented, and various other small bugs exist. Radikal Technologies is still working on bringing more features to the Spectralis, though the process may be slower than many would like. Despite these limitations and sluggish updating scheme, the Spectralis is an incredible synthesizer/groovebox/sequencer. The features are so complex and deep that they can keep an artist inspired for many years to come!",

and NOTCH mode (the DAF-1 also functions in SERIAL and PARALLEL modes).
In BAND mode, filter 1 is a highpass and filter 2 is a lowpass. In NOTCH

The Vermona DRM-1 is a true analog drum
synthesizer. You can synthesize up to eight drum sounds and they can be
triggered by MIDI and by an optional set of 10 Trigger Inputs. Each
sound has about 9 knobs for shaping the sound. And since it really is
analog (and not some virtual emulation) the sounds are more unique and
unpredictable than any other electronic drum synths currently available.With eight drum sounds and nine knobs per sound, the face of the DRM-1
is covered with over 72 knobs! The drum synthesis theory is based around
five predetermined percussive sound types. There are three DRUM channels
for creating bass drums, toms and numerous effect sounds. One MULTI
channel for creating typical analog Cowbell sounds and effect sounds.
One SNARE channel, which can generate numerous analog snare drums as
well as wacky sonar pings. Two HI HAT channels (open or closed), and one
analog CLAP channel. There are seven real-time sound controls plus
panning and volume on each channel.It has a stereo output but each channel also has its own audio output
which doubles as an insert patch for externally processing each channel
before reaching its main stereo mix outputs. A big unfortunate
over-sight is the lack of program patch memory. With all those knobs it
sure would be nice for some sort of instant recall of your favorite drum
sound settings. The front panel tilts so the DRM-1 is at home
rack-mounted or as a tabletop module. Anyone interested in creating
their own unique ANALOG drum sounds should check out the DRM-1! It makes
a great companion to the Vermona Perfourmer Analog Synthesizer module. The

It is a true analog synthesizer ideal for  basses, leads, pads and effect sounds!
It consists of four voices, each a separate synthesizer channel with its own VCO, VCF, VCA and LFO. Unlike
conventional synths, each voice is treated as a separate or monophonic synth,
each with its own knobs for tweaking. In fact, each synth channel gets 2 rows of knobs
(that's 18 knobs per synth channel). Each of the four synth channels are identical. This method of
synthesis allows users to create four totally different synth sounds which
can either be layered into unique textural sounds or treated as
separate multitimbral parts, such as a monophonic synth bass, monophonic synth lead
and polyphonic pads.Each synth channel consists of the following features and/or parameters: There is 1 VCO per channel
with 6 waveforms to choose from plus a white-noise generator. Pitch can be adjusted +/- 13
halftones. There's a 4-pole lowpass resonant filter with variable keytracking and ADSR envelopes
for the VCF and VCA. The VCA can also be modulated by the a fixed Gate envelope or the LFO.
The LFO has four waveforms and can modulate VCO pitch, VCF requency cutoff, and the VCA.The Perfourmer features some curious ways of linking the four synth channels together to
yield some interesting results. Unison mode combines all four voices into
a monophonic synth sound, great for creating simple to complex lead and bass sounds.
Duophonic mode combines Synths 1 and 2 into voice no. 1 and Synths 3 and 4 into
voice no. 2. This is ideal for creating two-fingered (duophonic) pads, like perfect fifths, fourths and octaves.
In Polyphonic mode, all channels function as a 4-voice polyphonic for even better pads and
textures.Additionally there's also an FM mode where Synths 1 and 3 don't produce audible sound, but rather,
function to modulate their neighboring channels 2 and 4. The Perfourmer can also be used
as a 4-channel filterbank. There are audio inputs to the filter for processing external audio.
Each channel has it's own individual audio outputs in addition to the stereo Main Mix outputs
in the back of the unit. These output jacks double up as insert jacks for externally processing
each synth channel. With some creativity and some TRS insert cables you can actually route signals
between the channels, ie: send VCO1 from Synth 1 out into Synth 2 so that it
is processed by both VCFs, VCAs, and LFOs in Synths 1 and 2.MIDI is the main means of playing the sounds you create with this synth. However, four optional
CV/Gate inputs (1V/octave) can be added for controlling each synth channel from other analog gear.
Cutoff frequencies of each synthesizer channel can be controlled by MIDI, but not by CV.
The lack of on-board program memory is disappointing. With over 72 knobs, being able

analog synthesizers produced by German music company Vermona throughout the 1980's.
It is a 2-VCO monophonic analog synthesizer. It has most basic analog edit
parameters. A 24 dB/oct analog VCF (filter) with 4 knobs (Brilliance, CutOff, Resonance, Contour),
a single LFO to modulate the VCO or VCF sections and a typical ADSR VCA envelope.
There are preset VCF and VCA settings as well as a Manual mode, but there is no
real Patch setting storage available. Also absent are MIDI and CV or Gate.Its sounds are pretty basic analog stuff. It makes a real nice
analog bass. The string sounds are questionable. But with only 2 VCOs and such limited
programmability, you won't get a whole lot of stuff out of this synth. There are no 
on-bard arpeggiators, sequencers or multitimbral options. The only
real effects on-board is the portamento-like Glide effect and Vibrato.
Colorful knobs, a clean layout, vintage wood end-cheeks and a genuine analog sound.

pieces of vintage synth technology. Released in 1980, the ADS (Advanced
Digital Synthesizer) 200 was well ahead of its time - yet only two
were reportedly made and at a price tag of $30,000 each! The ADS 200
followed up on the heels of the original ADS 100 of 1980 (only one made, never sold) which was a very large and
high end analog synthesizer consisting of a dual manual splittable
keyboard (microtonally tunable), programming interface, a separate TV
monitor (for envelopes) and roll-around 'control cube' disk drive with
computer hardware. The ADS 200 sought to become more commercially viable
by combining the whole package into a single (but very big) all-in-one
version. The original ADS 100 was most notably used for making some
of Star Trek's motion picture sound effects.The ADS 200 featured 64-oscillator additive synthesis and real-time
sequencing via four track sequencer combined with CV and gate
interfaces, phase modulation (CZ-like), frequency modulation (FM with
256 operators in any configuration), nested phase and frequency
modulation and a 16 stage graphic envelope for both frequency and
amplitude. Its display also supported musical notation. Wendy
Carlos said that it was the most sensible human interface yet seen
on a digital synth. Only one of the two ADS 200 units was ever sold, and has been used by the Moog
Cookbook but is currently owned by Brian Kehew.In 1982 Con Brio released the ADS 200-R, a 32 voice version (expandable
to 64) featuring a 16-track polyphonic sequencer with 80,000 note
storage capability and editing functions available from the scoring
screen. The dual-manual keyboard was replaced by a single manual of 61
keys. Pricing was also reduced to about $20,000, but only one of these
models was ever built and sold (also currently owned by Brian Kehew). Con Brio's days came to an end once the
digital synthesis revolution (like the much cheaper Yamaha DX synths) took
over.",

German synth manufacturer Music And More (MAM). It has 50 on-board knobs
to tweak its five analog drum sounds. These include Bass, Synth, Snare,
HiHat and Metal. Each sound has ten rotary knobs that can be used to
adjust a variety of parameters for that sound, such as
attack/decay/release, stereo panning, filter cutoff and resonance,
volume, FM depth and tuning. Sound quality is a bit noisy and a bit
dirty — but in a good, analog kind of way. The ADX1 is
rack-mountable with a metal faceplate that has been seen in both blue
and silver color schemes.Unlike many other drum machines, the ADX1 is purely a
synthesizer—there is no on-board pattern sequencer. There is also
a complete lack of patch memory. However, there is MIDI I/O, stereo
outputs, individual outputs for each sound, and on-board Trigger buttons
to fire off each sound from the front-panel which is useful when
crafting the sounds.As mentioned, the sounds are all analog. And all those knobs do allow
you to create some great analog drum sounds—the kind that you
might hear from Kraftwerk or Nine Inch Nails. The Snare and HiHat sounds
both feature ""open"" and ""closed"" variants. The sounds can be quite
unique, but also fairly capable of emulating most of the classic analog
drum sounds of the past such as those from the Roland X0X line, although
the Bass doesn't seem to have the same punch as a 909 kick. The Snare
is a lot like the classic Simmons machines. Its HiHat and Metal sounds
seem to get the most praise from users around the interwebs. The
envelope and filter controls on the HiHat allow for some really cool
animated HiHat patterns. And the Metal sound is more of an
analog-explosion sound, rather than a ride or crash.The closest competitor to the ADX1 out there would probably be the Vermona DRM. However, the ADX1 is far
cheaper and grittier. The ADX1 ceased production when MAM was
bought/sold to another company called Terratec. Its combination of
modern MIDI implementation and internal circuitry with old-school analog
sounds and low-budget construction make the ADX1 an affordable
supplement to your existing synth studio, as well as very fun and
capable entry-level analog drum synthesizer.",

It is a true analog monophonic bass synthesizer with MIDI
implementation so you can create 303-like bass lines from your
sequencer. Its single VCO offers the same two basic waveforms as the
TB-303: a sawtooth and square wave. But in the MB 33 they can be mixed
together for a more interesting tone than the 303 could originally
produce.Additional knobs control the VCO tuning, filter frequency cutoff,
resonance, envelope mod amount, envelope decay time and accent intensity
- the same controls found on the TB-303! The 24dB lowpass filter can
also produce the characteristic sound of the 18 dB filter used in the
original 303. There's also an auto-slide function (4 octave range) for
producing those 303-style slides and a separate input for filtering
external signals through it. Unfortunately there is no program storage.MB 33 mkIIThe MB 33 mkII (pictured above) released in 1998 adds a few more features.
The 24dB filter has been replaced by an 18dB filter just like the original
TB-303 used. A new sub-oscillator was added and can be mixed with the other
two waveforms for even meatier mono-bass sounds. A new distortion effect
is also present and can be dialed-in to dirty things up - sounds great when
resonated at high frequency cut-offs! MIDI can send/receive controls
for the cutoff, resonance, ENV mod, accent, decay, distortion, and autoslide on/off.Whereas the original MB 33 and Freebass 383 before it sounded very much the
same as the TB-303, the newer MB 33 mkII adds even more possibilities

A vocoder
lets you create robotic vocal effects. You basically feed two
sounds into it, the sound you want to process (Synthesis Input) such as
a synth lead or synth pad, and the sound that will do the vocoding
(Analysis Input) such as your voice or a drum loop. The Analysis input has mono Mic and Line inputs. The signal you plug in
here will be separated into 11-bands which cover a frequency range of
50Hz to 12kHz. The unique frequency spectrum of the analysis input sound will have different 
amplitudes at each of the 11 analysis bands. So a low frequency specific sound will generate
lots of voltages in the low frequency bands, but very little to no
voltages among the higher frequency analysis bands. The amount of voltages
generated by these bands depends entirely on the harmonic content of the
Analysis sound input. Voltages generated by these analysis bands go on to control up to 11 Envelope Detectors on the
Synthesis channel. The Synthesis channel is also split into 11-bands
and each band passes through a VCA envelope controlled by these Envelope Detectors.
The end result is that the Synthesis input's envelope is generated by the harmonic
content of the Analysis input sound. The VF-11 has its very own, albeit very simple, analog VCO to use on the
Synthesis channel in lieu of external audio. This oscillator offers only
a sawtooth waveform with a simple pitch adjustment knob. The VF-11 has
only a mono output which can output the processed or unprocessed
signals. The VF-11 can also function as a filterbank! Plug a sound to
the Synthesis channel, and nothing into the Analysis channel. Then you
can adjust the gain of each of the 11 bands. It isn't resonant, but it
works. The VF-11 is analog and affordable. There's no MIDI or memory and
you'd need two of these to process stereo audio. It's a good 'starter'

well: it creates kick/bass drums using a fully analog voltage-controlled
oscillator. All bass drum parameters and sound production are identical
to the XBase 09, XBASE 999 and the
AirBase 99. The MBase 01 has 64 Preset
bass drum sounds ready for use, 10 User presets and full MIDI control to
trigger and edit all of its parameters.The MBase 01 can be played via MIDI in one of two ways: from
keyboard-note C1 only with the pitch designated by the patch, or
chromatically across an entire keyboard (some pretty hefty bass sounds
and synth tones are possible in this mode). It can also be triggered by
an external audio sound source, such as a drum sound or trigger pad, or
via the ""Play"" button on the front panel.The interface feels a touch fiddly at first, but is very easy to come to
grips with. All editable parameters are available from the interface and
are arranged in two columns. Each column has a set of up/down buttons
allowing the user to select a parameter to edit. Only one parameter can
be edited at a time via the lone pot, and the current value of the
parameter is shown on the 7-segment 3 digit LCD display. The editable
parameters include Tune, Pitch, Decay, Harmonics, Pulse, Noise, Attack,
EQ and LFO settings.Most of the parameters are obvious, but three of them in particular
deserve further mention. ""Harmonics"" gradually adds more
harmonics to the sound, making it sound a little more distorted or
complex. According to the manual this shapes the sound from a sinusoid
waveform into a parabolic waveform. ""Pulse"" changes the attack
of the sound by adding a clicking pulse shape waveform which goes to the
VCA. ""Noise"" adds noise of course, but the interesting aspect
of this feature is that one can interrupt the Attack and Pulse portions
of the sound and replace them with Noise, or mix them together.The MBase 01 features an LFO which modulates the VCO via four
parameters: Wave, Speed, Intensity (amount) and Sync. There are four LFO
waveforms: Saw up, Saw down, Triangle and Rectangular. The Speed
parameter is set by either MIDI sync or in Beats Per Minute from 41
through 290 bpm. Sync can be free-running or triggered on each
key-press, resetting the LFO. This can make it useful as a second pitch
envelope.As one can imagine, the breadth of controls on offer allow for a wide
range of bass drums that can be created. Classic 909 and 808 style bass
drums are easily possible, as is everything in between—from
remarkably clean-sounding minimal blips to hard, banging thumps. JoMoX
have since released the MBase 11 which adds
further improvements, but the 01 is still a very capable and
good-sounding drum synthesizer.",

looks almost exactly the same. It is still a VCO-based analog bass drum
synthesizer with a lot of control over shaping the sound it creates. For
a general overview of the MBase, consult the
MBase 01 review.There are three major new parameters for the MBase 11: Compression, Gate
and Metal Noise. It is now also possible to control the volume of the
MBase's output and Preset patch memory has been increased from 64 to 100
patches.The new Compression parameter affects the decay phase of the bass drum,
effectively slowing the first half of the decay, and adding sustain to
the tail of the sound. If there was one deficiency in the MBase 01 it
was a relative lack of tone control during the decay phase. Sure, the
LFO could add movement, but the new Compression feature noticeably
punches up the bass drum tail.The new Gate parameter allows further substantial shaping of the attack
portion of the bass drum. The gate time can be set between 0.1ms to
16ms. This may not seem particularly wide, but it does make a
significant difference to the attack, opening it up to allow more noise
in, or shortening it to minimal blips.The new Metal Noise parameter alters the character of the noise feature,
shaping it into something more metallic sounding. Interestingly, the
value range does not indicate the amount of MetNze
added, but rather the type. The MBase 11 manual describes this as
follows: ""On values above [000] a complex signal made
from high pitch digital multi tones and the bit pattern of the value is
created. Each unique single pattern is corresponding to a value
number."" So don't expect settings 167 and 168 to sound
similar as they are in fact quite different. This feature adds a vast
amount of depth and color to the bass drum sound and, frankly, makes the
01 model seem somewhat limited by comparison.The LFO has eight waveform settings: Saw Up, Saw Down, Sine Ascending,
Sine Descending, Triangle Ascending, Triangle Descending, Rectangular
from Max to Min, and Rectangular from Min to Max. Effectively this gives
you only four basic waves (as on the MBase 01), but with the ability to
choose their polarity. The maximum speed is still limited to 290 BPM,
same as on the MBase 01.The MIDI implementation has a minor improvement: where the MBase 01
allowed control of only eight parameters via CC, the MBase 11 allows
control of another eight, including the Compression and Metal Noise
amounts, and now full control of the LFO parameters (the LFO could not
be controlled via CC on the MBase 01).Two minor disappointments are that the output is still unbalanced, but
even more frustratingly there are still only ten user patches.
Apparently the factory presets can be overwritten but JoMoX mention the
flash RAM they reside on has a very limited number of write cycles.JoMoX haven't made very many changes to the MBase 01, the core of the
MBase 11 is very similar, but the additional parameters allow for far
more sound shaping. If you already own an 01, upgrading to the 11 may be
worthwhile. If you don't own either, the 11 is a substantial improvement
over the already powerful 01 and is certainly the one to consider of the
two.",

sawtooth, square and pulse with pulsewidth-modulation. But in addition to these
are the new Ramp Controlled Oscillators (RCO's). The RCOs follow the VCO characteristics
like modulation, sync, tuning and frequency alterations. The RCO's
use digital sounds which come from 4 wavesets, each with 256 waveforms each. In effect,
these digital sounds get an analog treatment for nicer, warmer and fatter tones. There
are 4 RCO's per voice and wavesets can be added via PCMCIA-card. The filter section is also a true analog design but with very modern features. 
It is a 4-pole filter but fully
configurable with independent high pass and low pass features available. Create
filters that range from the sounds of a Minimoog, to the squelchy 303.
Filter settings can be stored in one of two scene memories and real-time
Morphing between scenes can be accomplished.As for modulation, JoMoX has devised a clever Routing System for the SunSyn, turning it into an 8-voice modular! It
is used to virtually patch between various modules or parameters. 
There are up to 4 Routing Elements per voice with 4,096 possible combinations 
per Routing Element. Modulation paths are configured using the front panel display 
screens. This modular approach to signal routing is 
a feature usually found only on the huge, expensive classic Modular synths
by ARP, E-mu, Moog and Buchla. Unlike those, however, the SunSyn features complete
patch memory (350 patches and 150 multi-patches) and multitimbral MIDI implementation.
Most parameters can be controlled by MIDI, and controller/editor templates for
most sequencers will be, or already are available. As for output, there are stereo outs, 8 freely 
routable individual outs and a stereo input to run external audio through the Routing system.The new SunSyn is a true analog synth built for the wealthy synthesists of today.

It offers the same types of analog controls that the TR-808 and TR-909 did such as tuning, level, decay, snap, etc. However it provides more of these controls for more sounds than the originals ever did and has MIDI implementation and Patch memory making the XBase 09 a much more versatile machine than those originals. Kick and snare are true analog, not emulation and not sampled. The Hihats, cymbal, ride, rimshot, claps and noise sounds are samples but are still quite tweakable. All your edited sounds can be stored into the 100 patches of memory. Use the built-in LFOs to modulate the Bass drum pitch, Snare Tune, Snare Snap, Snare Noise Tune, HiHat Tune or LFO 2.The XBase 09's built-in sequencer is also more advanced yet faithful to the style of its mentors. Step or Real-Time programming just like it's done on the 909 and 808! However, on the XBase, any edits to the sounds will also be stored with the pattern or song! This really liven's up your beats and allows you freedom and control to do things not easily possible on the original beat boxes! There's also an extensive Shuffle mode. Of course the XBase 09 is also happy as a simple drum tone module, with all editable controls accessible using MIDI. The controls also send MIDI data when tweaked so you can record real-time edits into your external sequencer. If you're looking for the TR-909 that should have been, here it is! Authentic sounds with more functionality and modern MIDI specs make this the perfect 909 for the 90's and beyond. Its only limitations are 3 voice polyphony and it's expensive. The AirBase-99 is a cheaper rack-mount alternative with added Toms. ",

Released in 2005, Alesis managed to cram four powerful synthesis engines and an 8-track, 24-bit hard disk recorder into the Fusion's sleek, silver frame. The types of synthesis on offer include Sample Playback, FM, Virtual Analog (VA) and Physical Modeling – all powered by three floating-point Texas Instruments digital signal processors. It comes in 61-key synth action (6HD) and 88-key weighted (8HD) versions. The Sample Playback engine lets you create four oscillator patches from either ROM multisamples or your own custom samples. Your samples can be recorded in through the dedicated stereo port, or loaded in via compact flash/USB; you can then edit and store them on the Fusion's large hard drive (40 or 80 GB). Import of WAV and SoundFont is supported, opening up a massive world of sounds. With 64MB of RAM, expandable to 192MB (and tricks available to double the usable amount of RAM) you won't fit a massive orchestral library in this synth, but for most sound design and live applications it will be plenty. Your samples can then be shaped using the Fusion's plethora of filter types, envelopes, and its massive mod matrix – nearly anything can be routed anywhere!The six-operator FM engine can give you those DX-type sounds, full of character. However, it isn't compatible with DX SysEx, but you can still have a lot of fun creating your own sounds. The VA engine is very powerful, with many similarities to the Ion/Micron line! There are three oscillators with multiple wave shapes, FM, Sync, PWM and 20 different filter types including lowpass, bandpass, highpass and a 4-band EQ for every patch. The Physical Modeling section includes both a Wind and a Reed model, and while not amazingly realistic, they can be abused to create some very strange pads!Putting all these synthesis types together, you start to see the power of the Fusion. Using Combis you can mix and match all of them, run them through effects, create massive evolving soundscapes using SoundFonts mixed with physically modeled wind and big VA strings, and more. Trigger loops and arpeggiators with one hand while doing a six oscillators thick lead synth freak-out with the other, the possibilities are staggering!The effects section is OK. The distortion is a little weak and needs tweaking to get really gnarly results, but the bread and butter effects are all decent enough. The Hard Disk Recorder and Sequencer are basic but quite useable as a musical sketch pad. For example, if you and a guitarist wanted to jam something out, you could record your keyboards as a MIDI part to the sequencer, and then record a guitarist’s amplifier through one of the 8-track HD recorder's inputs on the back of the machine. Speaking of inputs, connectivity is generally good with eight quarter-inch inputs for the multi-track, stereo sampling in, two main outputs, two auxiliary outputs, MIDI, USB 2.0, all the things you'd expect on the back of a modern keyboard.With all these features at a price point under $1,000, you'd think that this synth would be massively popular. However, early in its life there were some annoying bugs in the firmware, and some features were initially under-developed, such as the pattern-based sequencing. Although Alesis did a great job of releasing regular updates over its first three years, the Fusion's reputation became tarnished enough to blow it into obscurity.The Fusion isn't perfect, it has issues like any piece of hardware, but for the price they can be had today, they make a wonderful performance keyboard, sound-design tool, and all around synth.",

It offers continuously variable wave shapes (sine waves can morph into square waves), plus osc-sync and FM synthesis. 16 filter types are included, along with two LFOs, Sample & Hold, and an Arpeggiator-all of which sync to MIDI clock. A powerful and intuitive modulation matrix is built in, as well as a 40-band vocoder that does not use up any polyphony. External stereo audio can be processed through the filters, effects, or the vocoder.Though not a true analog like the Andromeda A6, the Ion is capable of creating a wide variety of sounds from warm thick analog pads all the way to gritty monophonic leads and basses, as well as some funky and realistic sound effects. The Ion also simulates the best of the classic analogs such as Oberheims, Roland Jupiters, Arps, Moogs, etc, largely due to its great filters - there is hardly any aliasing even on the highest tones. The Ion also comes equipped with not one but two modulation wheels, both assignable to mods in the mod matrix (LFOs only assignable to mod wheel 1). The Ion has an amazing range of tonal possibilities.  The chic design, layout, and large backlit screen make editing on the Ion a dream! The Modulation Matrix is easy to understand and can route any modulation parameter to almost every component of the Ion!! All parameter knobs (excluding master volume & menu knob) are 360 degree pots allowing you to twist all the day long! A 160x160 graphic display provides instant visual feedback as a parameter is edited. Along with having 512 patch settings (all user-rewritable), the Ion has 64 multi-timbral setups.

effects-box geniuses at Alesis. There's 64 voices of polyphony
and 16 parts multitimbrality and tons of memory and expand-ability
packed into to this big, blue, beautifully laid out performance
synthesizer. Based on the original QuadraSynth
series, The QS6 has 8 MegaBytes of samples and uses digital
additive/subtractive sample playback synthesis to create high quality
stereo grand pianos, organs, strings, drums/percussion, brass,
woodwinds, new and classic synth textures, General MIDI, and
rhythmic/sonic loops. Most of them sound pretty darn great too! However
Alesis had not yet fully anticipated the dance craze and so this is not
one of those ""physical-modeling"" synths that began appearing at the
same time. And sadly, in addition to the north-bound Pitch/Mod wheels,
there are only just two real-time assignable control sliders for live
tweaking, which is not a lot at all.As a master synth, the QS excels in it's price range, except for that
tiny LCD display which makes navigating through the pages and pages of
program settings pretty tedious. The QS6 implements the powerful QS
Modulation Matrix, allowing users to assign virtually any controller
source to any modulation parameter. There's an onboard multi-effects
processor (based on the QuadraVerb 2) with four totally discrete effects
busses that include reverb, delay, rotary speaker simulation,
distortion, chorus and much more. With a direct Mac or PC hook-up,
loading patches and editing via software is a snap! QS synths shipped
with Alesis' Sound Bridge software for Mac/PC which lets you write AIFF
and WAV samples, Standard MIDI Files and Program data to PCMCIA Flash or
SRAM cards. It can play Standard MIDI file sequences from the expansion
cards without the use of an external sequencer. For an all around
versatile modern synthesizer that isn't focused just on dance or trance,
be sure to consider the QS6.More demanding players may want to check out the more professional
QS7 (76 semi weighted keys), QS8 (88 weighted keys with piano style hammer action) 
and QSR (rack-mount) versions. They also featured double the sample-ROM
and many other upgrades! By 1999, all the Quadrasynths were being replaced by the QS6.1, 7.1 and 8.1 versions.",

applications and demanding players, the QS7.1 (76-key)

and melody synth sections, and an analog drum section.The Chord/Melody section has only 1 sound. The drum section is similar
to the TR-606 Drumatix, and the bass section is
similar to the TB-303 Bassline (some limited
adjustments in sound were possible via software). It has separate
melody, bass, chord, rhythm, mix outputs. There's also 8 cv/gate outs to
run external analog equipment by control voltages, and there's a click
in/out. On the face it has knobs for portamento, Melody sustain &
decay, Bass decay, and Chord decay. It also has volume level sliders for
each of the instruments and a master volume slider. The software uses a
similar music programming method as the MC-8 or MC-4.It's definitely a limited instrument today, but it's unique, quirky and
capable of some nice analog Roland sounds for cheap. If you have an old

By joining 8-bit PCM samples with ""LAS"" synth-generated sounds, the D-50 is capable of unique and complex sounds. The PCM samples contained the attack transients, while the rest of the sound came from the Linear Arithmatic Synth (LAS) section which sounds very analog, with subtractive-style synthesis and low-pass-resonant filters. Built-in chorus and (for the first time) digital reverb are also included for giving your sounds space and life! It also has a joystick controller for real-time timbre manipulation.

It actually has more in common with the U-20/220 series ROMplers than with the D-50/550, which it was ""kind-of meant"" to replace. In fact, if you open it up, you''ll find the circuit boards are labelled ""U50"". Unfortunately, the D70 / U50 was rushed into production, to compete with the likes of the Korg M1 and T1/T2/T3ex series machines, and this lack of design care shows when navigating the user-interface, which could be politely described as ""challenging"". So, given the similarities to the rather mediocre U-series sample ROMplers, and the ""Super-LA"" name....what to make of it?The D-70 has a sample playback engine married to D50 style TVF filters, together with on-board effects, and a percussion soundset. The filters are resonant, and add some much needed ""welly"". This is the D-70's redeeming feature, because the filters are actually pretty damn good. It's a shame that (to this reviewer's knowledge) it doesn't seem possible to filter the drum samples though.Performance wise, the D70 has a good quality 76 note keyboard in a sleek housing, and given its size, it's remarkably light. It is equipped with a large LCD display, to the left of which are 4 assignable faders. There is a fifth controller fader, labelled ""C1"" just above the pitch bender, in between the volume and brightness (filter cutoff) faders. The faders can be assigned in real-time to the following parameters: Level, Pan, Tuning, Cutoff, Resonance, Attack, and Release, using the keypad to the left of fader 1. The four faders equate to the four tones that can be used to make up a patch, rather like the D50's ""upper / lower partials"" although the more tones you apply, the lower the polyphony. This gives the performer real-time tweakability for doing filter sweeps, changing the relative levels of tones (for drawbar-style effects), etc. As an added bonus, the faders send MIDI data......which makes the D70 an excellent master keyboard for MIDI setups. It has keyboard splitting and zoning options that you'd expect to find on master keyboards. That's if you can decipher the midi implementation and work your way round an interface that redefines the word ""awkward"". Couple that with a 220 page manual, and it's not something you really want to do on stage, unless you've got it all worked out in advance. The D70 is one of those synths that you'll find yourself both enjoying and cursing in fairly equal measure.Sound-wise, the D70 raw samples are your typical U20/220 faire. In fact the D70 reads U220 series PCM cards, and has two PCM card slots on the rear of the unit, together with a RAM slot. This may not sound too appealing - if you're looking for genuine acoustic instruments, then it's not for you. But, the D70 has some remarkably good Rhodes and Organ patches, and some fantastic synth bass and lead sounds. Couple this with the on board fx, and it is a bit like a souped-up D50 with much better filters, which provide both squelchy resonance and knob-twiddlyness.To summarize, it's a nice ROMpler, albeit a little schizophrenic, capable of some wonderful classic Roland synth-noises, and makes a decent performance / live / master keyboard as well. It sounds better than the U220. If you're looking for a ""proper synthesizer"" you may be disappointed. Real shame actually; a bit more effort on Roland's part and this could have been a right little stomper. Due to the fact that it was never really a success, the D70 can prove very hard to find on the used market. But once you've got one, you probably won't want to let it go - it has JUST enough features in several different departments to redeem itself, and the warmth of the synth sounds belies their digital origin.",

Groove-oriented algorithms add space and effects to your sounds &
grooves. And with the D2's Megamix function, it's easy to remix patterns

control. However the hidden menus and overall navigation can cause some
headaches. If you want to edit your own sounds, you may want to connect a MIDI

hip-hop musician on a budget. It is not as complete a Groovestation
package as the MC-505 or MC-909, but its D-Field controller is very
novel and fun to use. Because the D2 is fairly cheap, it does make a
great toy to add to your arsenal if manipulating beats and grooves in

for live DJ use or as a starting point for writing your own tracks!
Unfortunately you can't program your own phrases. But you can alter the
sounds, tempo and so on to give them your own unique twists.Only the most important functions are immediately accessible and
real-time controllable. These include the filter cutoff, resonance, ring
modulator and reverb. A great new feature is an external sound input

Only one song can be recorded at a time but it can be created in
real-time by switching patterns and muting any of the eight tracks
allowing you to build and decompose your grooves on the fly! And the
built in speakers are actually quite nice allowing this synth a bit of
portability and they make the EG-101 ideal for the home user or budding

(128 seconds at Lo-Fi quality) and 31.25KHz (32 seconds at Non Lo-Fi).
Basic sample edit functions are also available such as pitch, time
stretch, filters, effects, auto-looping and truncating. Although these
specs may not be great, having any on-board sampler is a definite bonus
for any synthesizer workstation. For you budding new Dance artists or
those of you who just want a groove machine to play with on the road or

Most presets sound very similar to the Roland Juno 106, others remind of the Korg Poly800.24 preset programs are grouped in 3 banks, 2 visible and one hidden. Following the 80's trend, these programs are labeled with classical names (strings, brass, cello, flute), although in today's terms these are pure synth leads, pads, pianos and basses and don't resemble any acoustic instruments.The synth engine offers two oscillator modes: 8-voice polyphonic and unison monophonic; a rich, fat analogue filter and a classic Roland/Boss stereo chorus, similar to the JX-8p.The presets are:Poly (ensemble): Strings 1 and 2, Organs 1, 2 and 3, Brass 1 and 2, Polysynth;
Mono (solo): Bass 1 and 2, Cello, Clarinet, Flute, Violin, Monosynth 1 and 2;
Hidden Bank: 8 unnamed programs that could be described as analogue piano, rhodes, bells, harpsichord and clavinet.The first 2 banks can be accessed from the front panel or using Program Change MIDI messages, the third bank can be reached if you press ""brilliance"" button on power-up.Controllers:
1. ""Brilliance"" controls the low-pass filter cutoff in 8 steps
2. ""Attack"" controls volume envelope attack time
3. ""Dynamics"" controls how note velocity affects the volume and the filter cutoff and can be reversed (softer notes make louder and brighter tone).MIDI:
The EM101 receives MIDI on channels from 1 to 8. It does not support MIDI Control Change, Pitch Bend, Pressure or SysEx messages, so the best way to modulate the filter cutoff is via velocity change in the highest or lowest dynamics mode.A dual-voice mode can be achieved by using the ""split"" function.Other functions:
Volume control, Power Button, MIDI message display, oscillator fine tuning, output level selector.Inputs and outputs:

SH-series with the Gaia SH-01. The Gaia is an analog modeling
synthesizer that retains the basic traits of previous SH-series synths:
hands-on tweaking, user-friendly layout and compact design. You won't
find any screens or menus on this synth—so if you're in the market
for a hands-on, tactile synthesizer, the Roland Gaia SH-01 is not to be
overlooked. There are 64 preset sound patches as well as 64 user
patches—a huge improvement over the paltry 32 user patches in the
SH-201. Weighing in at less than 10 pounds and able to run on battery
power, the Gaia is a compact sound designing tool worthy of stage and
studio.The Gaia SH-01 features three oscillators, each with seven different
waveforms (saw, square, pulse, triangle, sine, noise and super saw).
Each of the seven waveforms have three variations, so it's almost like
having 21 waveforms to choose from…per oscillator! Course tuning,
fine tuning, oscillator sync and ring modulation controls, and a
two-part (attack/decay) envelope generator complete the oscillator
section. The filter section has all your basic controls (cutoff,
resonance, a dedicated ADSR envelope generator) but also allows you to
choose between low-pass, hi-pass, band-pass, or peaking filters. You can
also bypass the filter entirely. The amp section controls the volume of
the selected oscillator and has your standard ADSR envelope generator.
The Gaia essentially offers three LFOs at your disposal (with controls
for rate, tempo sync, delay time) that can be routed to any combination
of the oscillator, filter or amp.What makes the Gaia SH-01 stand out, is that although there is
physically one oscillator, one filter, one amp and one LFO, you actually
have three of each that are virtually layered over one another. In other
words, this synth can sound huge! Many synthesizers have any number of
oscillators that mix down before going to the filter and amp, but each
Gaia oscillator has its own filter, amp and LFO, allowing for some very
interesting patches. Furthermore, there is a dedicated master effects
section featuring distortion, fuzz, bit crusher, flanger, phaser, pitch
shifter, delay, panning delay, reverb and low boost. Each effect is
highly tweak-able and really helps bring its sounds to life.Of course, Roland has their ""D-Beam"" sensor for live
performance fun (or just showing off to your friends). There is an
onboard phrase recorder, arpeggiator, external audio input with various
voice-canceling options, V-link support, 37-key keyboard with pitch/mod
combo joystick, MIDI In/Out and USB connectivity to store patches to a
thumb drive or use the bundled patch editor software. No MIDI-Thru may
be an issue for some—the Gaia will need to be last in your daisy
chain.The predecessor to the Gaia SH-01, the SH-201, notoriously felt cheaply
made, particularly the keys and the plastic casing. The Gaia is still
plastic, but the keys feel much better than the SH-201 and the Gaia
feels less ""hollow"" and more robust than the SH-201.For well under a thousand USD, you'd be challenged to find a better
analog modeling hardware synthesizer. There is so much more to this
synth than meets the eye. On top of the fact that you have three
oscillator sections, filter sections, amp sections, and LFO sections
that all mix down to the master effects section, there is a
""Shift"" button that allows you to adjust countless other
parameters to further expand your synthesizing. Nearly every knob,
button and fader has a second function via the ""Shift"" button.
Roland could not fit all the ""Shift"" functions on the panel,
but the manual contains a list of these parameters and they are
logically laid out to help keep you planted in the groove of sonic
exploration.In summary, the Gaia SH-01 highly compliments the SH-series name and is
more than worthy of carrying the name. Analog purists, forget about
""analog vs. digital"" and just give this synth a try, it's
surprising how good analog modeling can sound when Roland does it right!",

The GR-500 is a vintage guitar controlled synthesizer - before there was MIDI too!
It was the first synth of this kind that Roland had ever produced, back in 1977.
The synthesizer module itself was a simple analog affair with Bass, Solo Synth, 
and String sounds based on previous Orchestral and analog mono-synths from Roland.
There are plenty of sliders to adjust the VCO, VCF, VCA, and LFO sections, but
no memory to store your edits.The synth module is controlled by a ""highly modified"" guitar. Notice all those knobs
on the guitar pictured above. It utilized a special pickup system that
connected to the synth module via Roland's own 24-pin interface and controlled it
using CV/GATE signals generated by the guitar's pickup system while playing the guitar. 
In addition to the modified pickup, there were magnets under the face of the guitar that could increase its 
sustain. Performance accuracy was ""iffy"" but good for 1977 and pre-MIDI. As a piece of
guitar-synth history, the GR-500 makes an excellent collectors item and may come in handy
for the occasional growl or a strummed analog sound effect. It has been used by Tangerine Dream, Mike Rutherford of Genesis
and Alex Lifeson of Rush.",

So now you can play synth sounds with the guitar instead of a keyboard. Sound-wise it's a pretty good synth. 
You will need the PG-200 programmer 
if you want to edit patches more easily. Recall patches by stomping on the
foot pedals.The GR-700 is a six voice polyphonic with two DCO's per voice which
means analog oscillators and sounds with digital stability and control.
The typical assortment of a resonant lowpass filter, ADSR envelope, LFO

Juno 106 that you can play anywhere with
those built in speakers! Another feature of this synth is its stereo MIX
IN, a stereo input for jamming with other sources of music through the
internal speakers. If you're going to use the HS-60 in the studio,
you'll need to insert a 1/4 inch plug into the headphone output to
bypass the internal speakers since they will continue to output sound
when a plug is inserted into only the main audio outs, and this can be

It
continues to be one of the most popular analog synths due to its great
sound and easy programmability. It was the next major incarnation of the
Juno-series, following the Juno-60. While it
has virtually the same synth engine as the Juno-60, the 106 added
extensive MIDI control making it one of Roland's first MIDI-equipped
synthesizers. There was also increased patch memory storage, up to 128
patches instead of the 56 patches available in the Juno-60. However, the
Juno-60 is often said to have a slight sonic edge over the more advanced
106. The 60 had the ability to modulate oscillator pulse from its
envelope and has a ""punchier"" sound quality.The Juno-106 is a six-voice polyphonic and programable analog synth with
one digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) per voice. While classic
monophonic synths used two or three oscillators to create a fatter
sound, the Juno-106 uses built-in Chorus to fatten up its sound to dramatic effect. The
nature of its DCO meant it was stable and always in perfect tune but
still warm and analog. There is an excellent 24dB/oct analog lowpass
filter with plenty of resonance and self-oscillating possibilities and a
non-resonant highpass filter. The programable pitch/mod bender can be
assigned to control the DCO pitch, VCF cutoff, and LFO amount all at
once or individually.The Juno-106 was the first MIDI equipped Juno and its implementation is
quite good. There are 16 MIDI channels available and MIDI SysEx data can
be transmitted/received from all the sliders and buttons for total
remote control and sequencing capability. A switch on the back of the keyboard, next to the MIDI
ports allows the user to switch between three types of MIDI modes:
Keyboard and Hold data only; Keyboard, Hold, Bender, Patch selection data;
or All data (including SysEx). Most users simply set it to MIDI Function mode 3 and forget it.This synth is incredibly straightforward and very powerful. It's
SH-series derived panel layout is easy to understand and very hands-on.
Use it to generate lush pads, filter sweeps, and funky bass lines and
leads. The Juno-106 is an awesome learning tool for anyone new to analog
synthesis, as well as an electronic musician's dream for its warm
analog sounds coupled with modern features like MIDI and memory - all at
a very reasonable price. And still the Juno-106 has an even cheaper alter-ego in the form

computer you will have much more advanced access to its four tone
generators, the TVF digital resonant filters, two LFOs (assignable to
the pitch, filter, panning and level simultaneously), multi-effects, and
many more Patch and Performance operations and parameters.What really sets the Juno-Di apart from its bigger siblings is its lack
of workstation features, most notably, the omitted sequencer and audio
recorder. It does have an arpeggiator with lots of preset patterns, but
you can't create your own, and it has some preset drum rhythm patterns,
but you can't create your own. There's also phrase sampling and chord
memory.The Juno-Di is really a giant sound-bank of Roland's latest sounds with a
61-note velocity keyboard attached. Although it may not be a studio
workstation, its portability features such as its light weight and
ability to run on batteries make it ideal for traveling musicians.
Additional features like Roland's D-Beam controller and a built-in
vocoder with a mic input (and its own dedicated reverb) make it ideal
for live performances. In addition, the ""Song Player"" can play
SMF, AIFF, WAV, and MP3 files from a USB stick, that you can then jam
along with like a real one-person band.The Juno-Di is nothing like the original analog Juno poly-synths, except
maybe for the look of the paint job. But it does offer Roland's latest
technologies in their most portable and entry-level package. It really
is a good general purpose keyboard for gigging but can also be good for
advanced players looking for a cheap, quick and easy to use synth for
lots of bread-and-butter sounds.",

Maybe. The Juno-G is a full-sized Workstation Keyboard
from Roland featuring much of Roland's current state-of-the-art
synthesis technologies, putting a studio's worth of sound, sequencing,
and audio recording into one complete instrument. It shares the same
high-powered processor as Roland's Fantom-X series but packages it in
a synth that looks very reminiscent of the old Juno-synths, and also puts
many of the controls at your finger tips. Not to mention, considering
what you get, the Juno-G is a very affordable synth.Roland's powerful Fantom-X sound engine offers up to 128 voices of
polyphony (a quantum leap from the 6 voices offered by the original
Junos). The sounds of the Fantom-X engine are typical of Roland's most
current sonic palette. This is no analog wannabe synth, its sounds are
purely digital although many analog modeled sounds are available. You
also get Roland's 88-note multi-sampled grand piano, and a wide range of
sounds that span from classical to cutting-edge. You can further expand
your Juno-G sound library with one of Roland's optional SRX expansion boards.True to its workstation capability, the Juno-G features an onboard
audio/MIDI recorder for programming and recording your own music
sequences. There is a 16-part MIDI sequencer
with dedicated transport controls and mixer. There are also four
companion stereo audio tracks which allow you to lay down live parts
from external audio sources (like vocals, guitar parts, etc.). Both the
MIDI sequencing and audio recording memory is ample, allowing room for plenty
of recorded ideas, performances, songs and parts.The Juno-G has a fairly user-friendly interface featuring a very large
back-lit LCD display (not a touch screen), clearly labeled buttons, six
knobs to modify sounds, five sliders for the audio section, a data
wheel, a D-Beam controller, and a pitch/mod lever. Additional performance controls
and features include the on-board Arpeggiator, Chord Memory and built-in
multi-effects. The Juno-G really has everything you need to perform,
compose, record and create your music. Of course it offers MIDI in/out
as well as USB connectivity for interfacing with computers (all MIDI
communications can be handled over USB, which can also be used to send
and receive WAV/AIF files and patch data). There's also a PC Card slot 
(which accepts CompactFlash or SmartMedia cards via adapter) for external 
memory storage.Make no mistake about it - this is not your father's Juno! In fact, this
may just be a slight repackaging of the Fantom synthesizers with a retro
namesake and look. If you were expecting the Juno-G to be the
reanimation of Roland's most famous vintage poly-synth, you may be
disappointed. However, if you are interested in Roland's cutting edge
synthesis engine, sounds and features in a synth with a retro vibe, the
Juno-G may be what you are looking for in an era where most equivalent
workstations have a polished and almost sterile personality. The Juno-G
is powerful yet affordable and user friendly, which is probably as close
to the original Juno as it gets.",

a large easy to read back-lit LCD display, dedicated performance knobs,
D-Beam controller, hands-free patch select, instant master MIDI control functionality and
much more. The Juno-Stage does not, however, have the sequencing/workstation capability of the Juno-G.The sounds of the Juno series are high quality digital wave-based sounds
of which the STAGE has a large 128 MB wave memory (double that of the Juno-G). The sounds are not
incredibly special, but they do cover a versatile range of synth &
keyboard sounds including an 88-key stereo multi-sampled piano (taken
from the Fantom-X), plus 2 open SRX expansion slots for sound set
customization. Sounds can be quickly accessed via Favorite buttons and
the so-called 'hands-free' patch select which is accomplished by using a foot
switch connected to a dedicated Patch Select jack, so you never have to
take your hands off the keyboard.Roland optimized Juno-Stage's controllers for live performance,
featuring easy-to-grab knobs for instant Master EQ and Reverb control.
Located above the pitch bender, two assignable switches can be used for
rotary organ effects, portamento on/off, and more. Juno-Stage is also
equipped with a USB port and Song Player function that enables direct
playback and control of backing tracks from a USB key. You can play MP3,
.WAV, AIFF and SMF files, and even use the Center Cancel feature to
minimize pre-recorded vocals for karaoke-style performance. Additional
features for live performance include an XLR mic input with phantom
power (plus reverb and vocoder), click output, and an external input for
a portable audio player. The MIDI Controller mode transforms Juno-Stage 
into a MIDI master keyboard with a single touch for using the Juno-Stage 
with a computer.If you like the sounds inside the new Juno series of synthesizers
and would like them in a retro-looking package fully suited to
handling the requirements of live performances and gigging,
the Juno-Stage may be your cup of tea. It is competitively priced
and full of modern features - sort of a Fantom-X-Lite for the
gigging musician.",

All of the Jupiters have a sound that was unlike any other synthesizer and the Jup 6 is no exception. This sound is due in part to classic analog Roland technology in its filters, modulation capabilities and a thick cluster of 12 analog oscillators at 2 per voice. Easy and intuitive programming via front panel sliders, knobs and buttons for all your tweaking needs. The Jup 6 is a scaled down version of the Jup 8 in terms of programming and polyphony. However the Jup 6 has some major improvements of its own such as newly added MIDI control and better tuning stability! While the Jup 6 does have MIDI, the implementation is very rudimentary and hard to control. The Jup 6 was one of the very first (along with the Sequential Prophet 600) synths to use the then new MIDI protocol, and the implementation on the Jup 6 is far from complete. Synthcom Systems, Inc. offers the Europa firmware upgrade for the Jupiter-6 which gives it an up-to-date and comprehensive MIDI implementation. All parameters are controllable via Continuous Controller or SysEx. Europa also features an extensive arpeggiator which will sync to MIDI clock with programmable clock divisors and rhythms, and has about 50 more playback variations than the JP-6's original Up, Down, Up/Down, and Down/Up. A Europacized Jupiter-6 is a thoroughly modern synth with a classic sound. The Jupiter-6 is an excellent for ambient drones, pads, blips, buzzes and leads. The Jupiter-6 is known for being a very reliable, programmable, polyphonic, analog monster of a synthesizer! It is used by Orbital, Moby, Überzone, Devo, BT, The Prodigy, Vangelis, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method, ZZ Top, Duran Duran, Moog Cookbook, and Blur.",

Easy and intuitive programming via front panel sliders, knobs and buttons for all your tweaking needs. The legacy of the Jupiter synthesizers is due to their unique voice architecture and design, creating sounds that were so unreal and amazing that they have to be heard! No other synths in the world can create analog sounds as cool and authentic as these. The Jupiter-8 was the biggest and fattest of them all (Jupiters and Junos)! It was one of the first synths to allow its keyboard to be split and layered - it's eight voices of trance heaven! Cross-mod, oscillator sync, a great LFO and a classic arpeggiator are also on-board. There's also a killer resonant analog low pass filter, same as the Juno-6 / 60, with the added option of choosing 2-pole (12 dB/oct) or 4-pole (24 dB/oct) modes as well as a separate high-pass filter. Unfortunately for the earlier models, tuning was very unstable but that seemed to be resolved in later models. Unlike its smaller counterpart, the Jupiter-6, the Jup 8 does not feature MIDI, only Roland's DCB sync can be found on some models. However, MIDI retro-kit's are available from various companies. Patch presets can store keyboard splits, arpeggiator settings, voice assign mode, hold, portamento and modulation settings. The Jupiter-8 has been used by Tangerine Dream, Orbital, Future Sound of London, Moby, Duran Duran, Underworld, Vince Clarke, Überzone, Jean Michel Jarre, Roxy Music, OMD, A Flock Of Seagulls, Depeche Mode, Rush, Meat Beat Manifesto, Banco De Gaia, Josh Wink, Thomas Dolby, Howard Jones, The Cars, Prince, Gary Wright, Jan Hammer, BT, Adrian Lee, Heaven 17, Kitaro, Elvis Costello, Tears for Fears, Huey Lewis and the News, Journey, Moog Cookbook, Toto, Yes, Devo, Freddy Fresh, George Duke, Greg Phillanganes, Jonathan Cain of Journey, Greg Johnson & Kevin Kendrick of Cameo, Stevie Wonder and Simple Minds. ",

On the one side you will find five sliders that control level and presence for both the internal sound source and the v-exp board. The other slider is assignable as a MIDI parameter and the bender, which can also control the modulation parameter.

The keyboard can be used in three modes:
- Patch: where you can play a single tone over the entire keyboard
- Performance: puts together a max of 8 patches
- Rhythm: plays one of the 5 rhythm sections of the keyboard
- V-EXP: when you have connected a VE-GS1 board to increase waveforms and polyphony, you can use this mode to play the V-Exp tones.

The JV-1000 offers great possibilities of expansion by adding a V-EXP board, PCM and data cards.

physically large workstation. In essence, it was a Sound Canvas (SC55)
with a sequencer, released at a time when Roland was making one Sound
Canvas clone after another. By the time the JW-50 hit the market, this
Sound Canvas would already be somewhat dated, and that's exactly what
sinks the JW-50 for professional studio usage. Apart from the infamous
128 GM (General MIDI) sounds and drumkits, there were also MT-32 sounds to be found in the variations.
While editing was limited to the common eight GM parameters, these MT-32
sounds saved the day a bit and offered the user a broader sound palette
to work with. Effects were simple-reverb or delay, and chorus or
flanger. While their quality was good, the limited amount of two effects
proved to be insufficient for some styles....which is a pity, because the sequencer was actually very good.
Creating a song was as easy as selecting a MIDI channel, selecting an
instrument, hit the record button and go. Afterwards, the usual
sequencer features could be applied, like quantizing and transpose. It
was also possible to change or create notes and other events in the
microscope editor. While the overview was not as vast as on a computer
with a large monitor, the display on the JW-50 was reasonable and
microscope editing was not at all bad.This microscope editor also allowed users to alter sounds using NRPN
events, and individual drums from the drumkits could be transposed
offering slightly different yet interesting sounds. Common things to do
were lowering the pitch of the tambourine for that metallic clang and
increasing the pitch of the power snare for that typical high pitched JV-80 snare. For die hard tweakers, the
JW-50 certainly offered something useful in its day. A bigger problem
was the limited voice count. With 24 voices (and some sounds used two
voices, something you couldn't change) the arrangements couldn't be
all that big. While the JW-50 offers voice reserve per track, a voice
limit would've been more practical. Often enough you'd find yourself
in the microscope editor trying to alter the lengths of notes to prevent
overlap, thus saving a few voices. It was certainly possible to make
interesting arrangements which weren't covered by that all too cheesy
Sound Canvas blanket, but you'd have to spend some time and effort in
order to get there.It's difficult to estimate the JW-50's practical value today.
Obviously, the Sound Canvas is a dated concept of almost two decades
old, it won't sound anything like the quality on today's workstations,
not to mention computers running plug-ins. The velocity sensitive
keyboard however is useful and offers aftertouch. The sequencer is by
now also a bit dated, it certainly isn't bad, but with LCD/TFT screens
on keyboards, synthesizers and workstations growing to small computer
screens, people would today probably expect the comfort of a small
computer in a workstation. With the current low street price of the
JW-50, it would certainly make a good entry instrument for beginners who
don't have the budgets for today's equipment, given they can live with
a traditional sequencer.",

This synth was the first Roland Synth to be fitted with a quality 76 note keyboard with velocity and aftertouch. Two DCO's per voice, two ADSR envelope generators per voice, and a resonant lowpass & non-resonant highpass filters are only the beginning. It has a 12 voice polyphony for a total of 24 oscillators and it is by far one of the most programmable synths of its time! However, as on the JX-8P, knobs and sliders have been replaced by low-profile buttons and a nice LCD display. Although this may look sleek and elegant, it makes editing a chore. Assign parameters to the alpha dial for tweaking, one at a time, or get the optional PG-800 Programmer to provide traditional, hands-on, dedicated sliders for editing the JX-10's parameters. The JX10 has a Chorus effect and a chase-play Delay function. The chase-play function allows programmable delayed repeats of voices by alternating patches of the upper and lower modules. The simple chorus effect is either off, slow or fast. It has two programmable sliders (if you don't use the PG-800) for some real-time control which can be recorded along with other effects and keyboard modes into one of the 64 Program Patches. This is in addition to its standard 50 preset and 50 user patch memory. A simple sketch-pad 1-track real-time sequencer is also on-board. It stores sequence data directly to an M16C card, or an M64C card for Patch/Tone OR sequence data. The M16C has a capacity of 400 notes, the M64C 1440, according to the manual.The JX-10 also comes in a rack-mount version known as the MKS-70. It's worth noting that the JX-10 can not be edited via SysEx, however the MKS-70 can which is one reason many have chosen the rack version over the keyboard. The JX-10 can make bulk dumps of its sounds over sysex, but only with (discontinued) Roland M64C RAM cartridges. The JX-10 has been used by Jane Child, Pink Floyd, Duran Duran, Angelo Badalamenti, Yellow Jackets and The Cure.",

It came out about the same time as the venerable JUNO series, but represents a shift away from the traditional analog synthesizer interface and towards a less hands-on format. The JX-3P was mostly aimed towards players looking for those great stable Roland sounds of the time, but with immediate Preset-based access to them, and only the most basic and newbie-friendly of on-board controls to adjust them. (Note the space reserved on-board for holding sheet music in place.) That is not to say this is a dumbed down synth, but rather, the digital technologies being explored by Roland at the time allowed for greater programability while simultaneously reducing the need for dedicated hands-on controllers per parameter - a path most synth manufacturers walked down during the eighties. This means that sliders and knobs were being phased out in favor of push-buttons, fewer sliders and a powerful programming interface tucked away “under the hood”.The JX-3P shares the same great analog filters and VCAs as the JUNO and even the JUPITER series. Just like the JUNO, it’s a six voice polyphonic feeding digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) through analog filters, envelopes and amps. However, the JX-3P has two oscillators per voice instead of the single osc. found in the JUNO synths, and while that does allow for greater flexibility, the onboard programming interface is a lot less fun and hands-on than that of a JUNO, no doubt contributing to the popularity the JUNO series enjoys over the JX-3P. You will need the optional PG-200 programmer if you want a real hands-on experience with the JX-3P. Surprisingly, the JX-3P is MIDI equipped, in fact it was Roland's first MIDI synth. However, its MIDI was limited to basic note on/off information only. Synths like the JUNO 106 had far better MIDI implementation. But the JX-3P also featured an on-board 128-step sequencer and came in a (slightly modified) rack-mount version called the MKS-30.  Although the JX-3P may not be as popular as a JUNO, it makes a great vintage synth capable of creating some lush, classic analog sounds. And without the cult status of other synths similar to it, they can also be found at bargain prices, making them a definite synth to consider when looking for those classic early eighties Roland sounds. And aftermarket upgrades (like the KIWI-3P) can make it just as good, if not better, than any other polyphonic analog synths out there! It has been used by The Future Sound of London, Astral Projection, Vince Clarke, Orbital, Luke Vibert, Stevie Nicks, and Thomas Dolby. ",

It has 6 voices of polyphony, great MIDI implementation and patch storage as well as an external memory cartridge slot. Though it is far more advanced than its predecessor, the JX-3P, the JX-8P has its drawbacks. Hands-on programming is sacrificed and reduced to assigning the parameter you want to tweak to a data-slider near the pitch/mod bender. Enter the PG-800 controller which gives you total control of all the JX-8P's editable parameters with hands-on traditional slider control. Membrane buttons dominate the front panel of the JX-8P providing access to the various preset and user patches and to page through and assign editable parameters.Professional features can still be found under the hood of the JX-8P. Its 61 note keyboard is velocity and aftertouch sensitive. Just like the Juno synthesizers it uses DCO's for a very stable system, however its sounds are a little thin and bright.

Combining an analog modeling synth, step sequencer, four-part audio
looper, and effects processor, this instrument helps musicians develop
loops with multiple variations. The MC-09 is a aimed at musicians, DJs
and synth enthusiasts who work with audio phrases and want powerful
analog-modeled synthesis at an affordable price.The Synth component features monophonic bass and lead synth sounds and
polyphonic rhythm sounds. There are six control knobs for tweaking the
sounds via filters, LFOs, etc. Sounds can be played via the MC-09's pads
and 32-step sequencer or MIDI. Drums can be programmed with Roland's
popular TR-REC method, first introduced on TR-Series Rhythm Composers.The audio looper is capable of playing back four monophonic phrases up
to six seconds each (phrases can be taken from the internal synth or
external sources). In action, users would create synth or drum patterns
using the step sequencer and then record them as audio loops. Looping is
simple since the PhraseLab uses BPM and measures to automatically stop
recording at the perfect point. Loops can be triggered with the step
sequencer anywhere desired-even at different pitches. And with the Chop
function, the MC-09 can automatically divide a loop into 16 ""slices"" for
constructing new phrases. The step sequencer is also capable of
emulating the TB-303's slides and accent effects.Also on-board are four high-quality effects algorithms: Filter,
Isolator, Phaser and Slicer. Effects can be applied to any of the four
audio loops or to live inputs, and can be controlled in real time via
the knobs for more intuitive tweaking. Once you've created your audio
loops and applied effects to them, you can save your work to an optional
SmartMedia card. Connections in the back are low-budget RCA style audio 
inputs and outputs, and MIDI In/Out is also available. A low cost synth 
which is great for a beginner, or somebody after 303 type sounds on a budget.",

Envelope and Mixer sections. The LCD display is a great feature too.The MC-202 was sort of a next-generation TB-303.
So the idea was to program sequence/patterns into it internally which
would give you those 303 basslines that we've come to love. But
programming the MC-202 is a bit too intense and over done for the simple
monophonic bass line. However you can control it externally by hooking
up a MID-CV/Gate converter. Then you basically have yourself an SH-101!The sequencer is actually a 2-channel CV/gate sequencer, with both
channels being capable of driving a separate external synth. It's a very
useful unit, also, for its DINsync capabilities; it can receive on one
port, and send over two, and also can 'split' DINsync to branch a sync
signal out to multiple devices.This machine is best for those who want to get 303-like patterns (it has
accent just like the 303) and basslines with an SH-101 sound. If you can
handle programming the notes into its sequencer you can have a lot of

Based on the XV-series synthesis engine with sampling RAM expandable up to 272MB (16MB standard), the MC-909 has evolved beyond the original concept of a Groovebox. This professional workstation boasts 800 new Patches, 64 Rhythm Sets and 693 all-new waveforms, with SRX expansion. And with professional sequencing, onboard effects, mastering tools and an ultra-intuitive interface-plus a USB port for exchanging samples and sequences with a PC, the MC-909 is all you need to take your music from conception to completion. The MC-909 is more than a Groovebox with sampling. Audio and MIDI can be integrated, synthesized and sequenced together within a single, easy-to-use environment. Sample some phrases and sequence them alongside MIDI tracks as the MC-909 synchronizes your loops automatically. Samples can even be used as raw waveforms in the synthesizer section, opening up a world of sonic possibilities. The MC-909's big LCD screen makes it easy to locate sounds, sample audio, edit waveforms and sequence MIDI arrangements. Nearly all major parameters can be accessed via knobs, sliders and buttons, while the dedicated Part Mixer makes mixing a snap. You also get two of Roland's most popular performance controllers: Turntable Emulation makes it possible to adjust pitch and time independently for MIDI or audio (thanks to some innovative realtime time-stretching), while Twin D Beams use an infrared beam of light for triggering samples, tweaking filters and more. On the inside is a powerful 4-Tone synthesis engine with stereo waveforms per Tone and 64-voice polyphony. Yet the MC-909 is still as easy to program as an analog synth-thanks to a generous supply of knobs, buttons and sliders. The MC-909 also comes with 16MB of sample memory, expandable up to 272MB using optional DIMMs. Audio can be recorded via the stereo analog inputs or digitally using the S/PDIF input. You can even import .WAV/AIFF files from a computer via USB. Samples can be processed in a variety of ways. Using Wave Edit, a waveform can be truncated and looped while viewing it graphically on the LCD. The Time-stretch function, on the other hand, makes it possible to change a loop's tempo without affecting pitch. Or, if you prefer to create your own loops, simply ""slice"" up a loop with Chop. You can trigger samples from the velocity-sensitive pads or via an external MIDI keyboard. The MC-909's 16-track sequencer has been improved in many ways with 480 ticks-per-quarter-note resolution. Patterns can also be up to 998 measures and a new version of Roland's popular TR recording method (similar to ""Piano Roll"" editing) makes it possible to view several notes at once using the pads and LCD. The MC-909's sequencer is fully compatible with Standard MIDI Files, allowing you to import and export SMF sequences via the built-in USB port. Of course, the MC-909 comes with hundreds of patterns-programmed by professional producers-that fully exploit the new sounds like UK hard-house, trance and the latest ""broken-beat"" hip-hop and R&B. And it's all expandable via SRX-Series wave expansion boards.There's no need for outboard effects with the MC-909. There's a 24-bit reverb that can be applied to each sequencer part, a new dedicated compressor, and two independent multi-effects (MFX) for the new filter algorithms-including a 36dB filter and amazing Step Filter-plus tempo-synced delay (up to four seconds), phasing, distortion and other proprietary effects like Lo-Fi, Slicer and COSM Amp Modeling. There's also a special Mastering processor which includes 3-band compression/EQ for creating ""final"" mixes.The MC-909 ships with a dance-oriented ROM containing everything from house pianos and organs to edgy techno hoovers and stabs-plus favorites like the JP-8000 ""SuperSaw"" waveform and distorted TB-303 sounds. There are also plenty of basses, pads and sound effects perfect for any track, along with a complete assortment of drum kits. New sounds can be added by installing an optional SRX-Series Wave Expansion Board. The SRX-05 ""Supreme Dance"" expansion has special Patches that can only be accessed on the MC-909. The SmartMedia slot allows for optional memory cards that can be used to store User data such as samples, patches, rhythm sets and patterns.

MIDI control change messages for expressive playing and realtime
tweaking via your MIDI keyboard controller or sequencer.The MKS-10 is an analog instrument, however for a Piano sound module,
its sounds really are not that great nor realistic. Although it

Released between the TR-33 and TR-77, this box's unique features and modern sound leave one wondering just why the hell you haven't heard of it before.

The machine is slow enough to mellow the chillest of ambient drones and fast enough to handle full Grindcore blast-beats. It also features a ""Balance"" knob that, fully clockwise, emphasizes that high hats and snare while killing the kick entirely and, fully counter clockwise, removes that hat entirely and lets the kick showcase its' ample beef and sonic girth. The kick itself is worth mentioning - many have stated it is as close as you are likely to get to a full-on Roland analog 808. And there is a good reason for this: Inside the easily slid back chasi are a number of potentiometers. This includes the magic ""Easter Egg"" knobs control, tempo range, snare filter cut off, swing rate, toms, decay and feedback (more on this soon), kick, filter cut-off resonance, decay and feedback.

It's like it includes a built-in circuit bending kit that won't necessitate you damaging the unit. This is the stuff genres are created from. As if it wasn't unique enough, this unit includes a built in speaker! And not some monotron-ish ""It'll do"" type speaker. A loud proud, warn and BASSY speaker that is loud enough for a band to practice to. The machine also comes with mono line out, footswitch on and off ports, a ton of mods that provide those brave enough to try them with individual outs and more sound shaping possibilities than you could ever hope for, a metronome switch that converts the ""Swing"" modifier button into a standard metronome that can be used alongside of internal beats and 8 top-quality Roland Analog drum sounds.  Throw in 10 preset beat buttons, all of which modify each other when combined (and not in predictable ways, in addition to a number of swing options, this box includes irregular time signatures -- try as many combinations as you can and you'll see how versatile this unit is) and what you have is probably the last true forgotten classic Roland TR drum Machine... you have the Roland TR Rhythm 330.",

Built into a hard case with detachable lid and a carry strap, its five F-F octaves offer full polyphony and three basic sounds that are set separately either side of a fixed keyboard split point (two octaves up).Strings I is a classic divide-down sawtooth sound, Strings II the same an octave above, and Brass, though not very ‘brassy’, is the same basic tone put through a different filter. The three sounds are all based on the same raw waveform, generated from a single divide-down oscillator, and can be switched in simultaneously. They are filtered separately, but all share the same volume articulation. Articulation sounds independently for each key on the keyboard, but is governed either side of the split by that keyboard half’s Slow Attack switch (which determines either a quick or less-quick attack), Volume Soft switch (which determines either full or reduced overall volume for that half) and the Sustain slider (which sets the release time for that half).Tone is controlled globally, set using just one slider for the Strings, and one for Brass, each of which is a kind of brightness control. There is no contouring of the filter response.Remaining control is limited to Vibrato, which affects the depth of a fixed-speed pitch variation, and Volume. The RS-101 was the first keyboard instrument to use Roland’s famous ensemble effect, and though there is no control over it, the four-Bucket Brigade circuit sounds great, and plays a huge part in that well-loved and familiar synthesizer string sound of the era.Interfacing is minimal, with two mono 1/4” outputs (high and low) - no triggers, gates, expression pedal control, just audio. It was superceded just a year later by the RS-202, which introduced changes to the ensemble circuit and added a few controls, but otherwise uses the same basic sound-generating circuit design and has the same form factor as the RS-101.Keeping things simple means the RS-101 is both approachable and playable. Its limitations mean it’s a bulky way to get *that* sound, but nothing quite feels like playing a true 70s string synth and the RS-101 may just be the cheapest way to do that.",

followed the lackluster RS-101. Oddly the RS-202 wasn't much different
than its 101 predecessor. The RS-202 had two new features: a
user-controlled delay for the vibrato, and an Ensemble/Chorus effect
(that would be seen on dozens of future Roland analog synths for years,
including the Junos and Jupiters). It makes the ultimate ""disco"" string sound.The RS-202 is fully polyphonic (all 61 keys can play simultaneously).
Basically three sound presets are in the RS-202: Strings I, Strings II
and Brass. Forget the brass, however, because this machine is all about
the strings, and for a time it was considered Roland's finest string
machine. Strings I covers low cello & bass type sounds and
Strings II is thinner and in the higher registers for Viola and Violin type
sounds.The keyboard is permanently split into two separate sections, the lower 2 octaves
and the upper 3 octaves. Each section has it's own set of identical
controls. These include three white On/Off buttons for each of the
three sound presets. This means you can assign any sound to each
section, and any combination; For example, set the lower section to
Strings II and set the upper section to Strings I+II+Brass if you like.
There are also two grey buttons in each section for ""Slow Attack"" and
""Volume Soft"". Each section also has its own sustain slider and there are
global brilliance sliders for the brass and string sections
independently.Basic effects included the Ensemble (chorus) effect and Vibrato. A
switching-slider is used to select Ensemble I, Ensemble II or Off. The
Vibrato effect section had just two sliders: Delay and Speed (depth
could not be changed). The Ensemble section did wonders for the sound of
this machine; the 'Ensemble II' setting introduced a rich chorus, whereas 
the 'Ensemble I' produced the faster, deeper ensemble effect that
became an instant classic. Sadly, like most vintage synthesizers the
RS-202 is mono (high/low output jacks on back) and provides only a trigger output
for an external synthesizer. It's built-in to a suit-case style housing
which made it easily portable. The RS-202 is a truly vintage and classic machine. Historically, it
launched Roland's signature Ensemble effect. It also sounded fantastic -
with or without the ensemble effect engaged. It easily stood up against
many competing synths of its time such as the Arp Solina.
It's been used by Tony Banks, Rod Argent, Tomita, Nick Magnus,
Jethro Tull, Camel, and Magnum.A sort of trivia regarding the RS-202: It was virtually cloned by an small 
American company called Multivox. they released the MX-202 which not only
looked almost totally identical to the RS-202, but also featured copied

split down the middle to assign different sounds to the left and right
sides of the keyboard.The Synth section has four waveforms (selected by the large white
buttons) and its own VCF with cutoff and resonance sliders, VCA ADSR
sliders and LFO features. The Bass section has three preset bass sound
types to choose via the big red buttons. It has its own VCA Attack and
Release sliders and Vibrato controls. The String section has two String
preset sounds - selectable via the big green buttons - and other features
borrowed from the RS-202.Sounds from the three tone sections can be blended for interesting
results and the built-in Ensemble chorusing effect really warms,
thickens and lushes up the sounds! The Paraphonic 505 also features an
external audio input (mono) so you could run another synth through the
quadruple-BBD Ensemble chorus. A new little performance control section
to the left of the keyboard provides convenient volume, tune, glide and
pitch bender controls. Similar to the ARP Omni, the Paraphonic 505 is considered one
of Roland's finest string synths of its era.",

slimmed down into a more affordable package! By today's standards the
S-330 would be considered limited and lo-fi, however for its time it was
a powerful instrument which can still prove useful for many music
applications today.Sample memory here is the same as the S-50:
750Kb which yields up to 28.8 seconds at 15kHz. That is half the sample
memory available in the S-550. Sampling specs are
unchanged, with variable sample-rates from 30kHz down to 15kHz at a 12-bit

in 2 banks. Roland has a vast S-50 compatible
sample library of sounds ready to be loaded via the built in 3.5 inch
disk drive. Samples of your own can also be saved to disk.When used with an external CRT monitor, editing
samples is a breeze and quite sophisticated. You get waveform drawing and smoothing,
auto-looping, tuning, multi-stage envelopes and you can quickly adjust loops
and samples. There's an RC-100 Remote Controller with an Alpha Juno type alpha-dial for easier programming
control. And the DT-100 Digitizer Tablet from the S-50 for drawing waveforms is also compatible when connected through the
RC-100 controller. There is also the SYS-333
sequencing software which offers basic drum machine type sequencing.New to the S-550 were the realtime Time-Variant filters as
used by the LAS-type Roland synths. These filters (and amps) are more
digital, more in-depth, more precise and were included in the S-330.While there are hundreds of modern samplers that will give you precise crystal clear perfect sounds these days,
something like the S-330 can give you the audio equivalent of Sepia tone
to your samples, coloring them with its unique mid-eighties technology

line-up of the early 1990's. Unlike previous S-series samplers, these
featured 16-bit sampling at rates up to 48 KHz. Compared to the
grittiness of the 12-bit S-550 and W-30,
these have a clean, professional and warm sound quality. The S-750
features 2 Mbytes of sample memory (enough for about 22 seconds at 44.1
KHz), a floppy disk drive, an external SCSI bus for adding more drives,
a very large built-in text/graphics LCD display, stereo input and
output, six assignable analog outs, a mouse and external video monitor
connections for enhanced control. The higher-end S-770 included an
internal 40 Mbyte SCSI drive and S/PDIF outputs.The S-750/770 features 24 voices of polyphony and 16-part
multitimbrality, allowing many samples and voices to be layered. A patch
can contain up to 8 layered or split samples. Each voice has a
time-variant filter (TVF) and amplifier (TVA), each with its own
5-segment envelope, and a shared LFO. The resonant digital filter is
multimode (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass) and uses the same excellent
algorithm as the Roland D- and JD-series synthesizers.Sampler inputs are located on the front, which is actually quite handy.
The ADC converters are excellent and combined with 20-bit internal
processing, the S-750/770 has an incredibly warm, smooth and present
sound character not found in many of today's mainstream samplers.Extensive sample looping, cutting, pasting, and editing capabilities are
available. A few non-real-time effects are present, including
sample-rate conversion, compression/expansion, pitch shift, and time
stretch. Most sample-altering operations have an undo capability.
On-the-fly resampling, with a selection of sample-combining algorithms,
is also available.  All operations can be accomplished from the front
panel controls, but are made much easier via the mouse and external
monitor or with the optional RC-100 remote
control which duplicates the panel controls and adds some features such
as a numeric keypad—handy when you need to enter an exact value
for a 6-digit word number. Sample library disks from the W-30,
S-330, and S-550
(but not S-50) can be converted (if necessary) and loaded as well.Roland S-750 (released 1991)The OS is complex and requires time to study and learn, but is very
powerful once mastered. The primary limitation of these models is memory
and storage; the factory-installed 2 Mbyte is not very much by today's
standards and inadequate for long phrase sampling. (There is an
almost-impossible-to-find memory expansion board that allows memory to
be expanded to 18 Mbytes.) The OS also contains a limit on the maximum
disk size that it can deal with—540 Mbytes. Also, the S-750's lack
of an internal drive means it needs the OS to be loaded from floppy
disk. Internal effects are non-existent, although the assignable outputs
make it easy to set up routings to external effects. If you want to use
an external monitor, you need one that can accept CGA signals and the
correct cable, or you can use the composite video out, but that will be
monochrome only; only the CGA output is in color.The S-750 and S-770 were ahead of their time in the early 1990's and
rival the capabilities of software samplers today. While it may not seem
relevant to use an early 90's hardware sampler today, the S-750/770 has
a unique sound quality that can not be found in modern digital samplers.
Their excellent converters coupled with great sounding filters made for
a really warm and rich sounding instrument. Add to that the large sound
library that can be used with it and you have yourself one of Roland's
finest and historic digital samplers.",

Amazingly, this 1973 synth has aftertouch, called the ‘Touch Effect’
which can be assigned to modulate the volume, Vibrato, pitch, ‘Wow’ and
‘Growl’ effects. A few other drawbacks to the SH-2000 is the total lack
of CV/Gate for external communication and no user memory.The SH-2000 is great for squeaky effects and growling bass notes.

SH-201, an analog modeling synthesizer that's both fun and easy to use
with plenty of features and cool sounds at a great price. The sounds and
controls are analog style, and the SH-201 features Roland's famous
Supersaw waveform (introduced in the JP-8000), resonant filter, saturation control,
and more. Unlike the original SH-synths which were monophonic affairs,
the SH-201 offers 10 voices of polyphony, which is perfect since we only
have 10 fingers and this is definitely a hands-on performance oriented
synthesizer.At its heart the SH-201 has two beefy analog-modeling oscillators
with ten analog styled waveforms. The two oscillators can be blended
together in the Mix section, and there is also oscillator sync and ring
modulation. Of course there is a filter section with High, Low and Band
pass filtering at 12 or 24 dB/oct slopes, with the usual cutoff,
resonance and key follow controls. Two LFOs add some modulation with 6
wave shapes plus sample-n-hold and multiple destinations. It also comes
with high-quality delay and reverb effects, an overdrive control, and
(like the SH-101) an arpeggiator function with
32 patterns.Like the SH-101 of the early eighties, the SH-201 is quite user
friendly, with a fairly simple and organized panel lay out (in a
logically positioned signal path from left to right) and every control
onboard is within reach. There are no complicated touch screens or
menus of parameters to wade through, just grab a control and tweak! The
keyboard is compact with just 49 keys and is only sensitive to velocity
(no aftertouch). Patch memory is a bit on the disappointing side, with
only 32 user and 32 preset patches. However, with its state-of-the-art
USB connectivity, the SH-201 can be connected to a Mac/PC computer
(both MIDI and audio can be routed through the USB port) and a VSTi
software editor is included, which allows SH-201 sounds to be edited and
stored from within a VSTi-compatible host software sequencer.The SH-201 also features external audio inputs with dedicated filters
and effects. The SH-201 also features Roland's D-Beam technology
allowing you to simply wave your hand above the D-Beam controller to
create some wacky pitch-bends or modulations to the sounds. While it is
clearly loaded up with Roland's latest technology it is packaged in a
synth that is easy to use and simple to understand, with instantly
accessible analog-type synth sounds that won't empty your wallet to
attain--and in that way, this truly is a Roland qualified to carry the
""SH"" designation.It is used by Richard Barbieri.",

There's also a full complement of knobs and sliders, analog-style 808 and 909 drums, DSP effects and a killer programmable arpeggiator - all at a reasonably cheap price. The SH-32 is more like an affordable follow up to Roland's JP-8000 and JP-8080 analog modeling synthesizers than the real SH-series synths of the seventies/eighties. But that doesn't mean it can't sound like an SH-101, for example. The SH-32 has awesome, aggressive filters, however audible stepping can be heard when slowly twisting the cutoff knob, but not so when modulated with the envelope or LFO. It has many more variations of each classic wave than older SH synths, offering 67 types of waveforms. Everything from thick bass sounds to entirely new sounds not possible on traditional synthesizers can be coaxed out of the SH-32.Every parameter is available on the front panel via knobs and sliders. There are no hidden menus, although the mass clutter of controls and information printed on the face of the SH-32 is a bit overwhelming, but look closer and it does seem as logically laid out and organized as possible.Whilst you can certainly hook this baby up to your MIDI keyboard or sequencer and go to town with its great sounds, the SH-32 is perfectly happy running stand-alone making it perfect for DJs, live musicians, and just plain having fun. It has no sequencer but does have an amazing Arpeggiator with programmable or tap tempo settings. There are 64 arpeggiations and 64 drum rhythm patterns and they can be fully programmed by the user. It even has a chord memory feature making it great for techno and trance style arpeggiations. Superb built in effects will sweeten up the sounds immensely as well, with 35 insert fx and 10 types of reverb and delay. The SH32 is a unique combination of virtual analogue synthesis, excellent rhythm sounds, rhythm styles, an arpeggiator, and other 'groove' facilities - with an affordable price and compact size.",

different waveforms. All of its editing controls which are just shy of
the SH-5's features have been crammed together all the way to the left
of the keyboard. This was an attempt to accommodate organ and piano
players who would typically put their synths on top of their piano. This

and band-pass filtering with cutoff, resonance, keyboard tracking,
envelope sensitivity (AR, ADSR or preset) and modulation (ramp, sine,
square, s+h) controls plus an additional band-pass-only filter. The two
VCAs offer Attack/Release and ADSR envelopes which can be triggered by
the Sample + Hold, LFO #2 or an external audio trigger input.Extra features include the standard SH-type Mixer section with 5 sliders
to adjust noise, VCO1, VCO2, ring mod and an external signal levels. 
Each of these 5 signals can be individually sent through the VCA, the
multi-mode filter, the band-pass filter or both. The SH-5 even has
stereo output with panning controls in the VCA section and portamento!

It was released as part of Roland's Groove Gear. The updated SP-808EX (pictured) adds a cool new translucent design, many enhancements, and is now dubbed the e-Mix Studio. Essentially the SP-808 is a phrase sampler with a pattern sequencer, hard-disk digital multitrack recorder, high quality studio-effects, and more! Both machines are geared towards sampling musicians, remixers, broadcasters and DJ's. The original SP-808 (GrooveSampler) can play up to four stereo samples simultaneously. If that seems a little thin, you can always bounce the samples down with any mixing, editing and effects you may have applied, opening up those tracks for more samples. It samples at 44.1 and 32 kHz sampling-rates, with a maximum sample time of 25 minutes of stereo 44.1 kHz sampling! Sample via analog or digital inputs, the SP-808 holds over 1,000 samples! Its sampler has a full set of editing features and some nifty tricks to make sampling very easy! BPMs of loops can easily be adjusted to match song tempo. All samples are stored/read directly from the 100 MB Zip Drive rather than internal RAM memory. AIFF and WAV audio formats are not supported as Roland is using their own proprietary sample storage method to maximize sample space on ZIP disks.Studio quality effects include a filter, reverb, delay, pitch shifting, distortion, phaser, compression, Karaoke mode, and many more effects. There's also a D-Beam controller to tweak pitch and volume - Theremin style. Effects are realtime tweakable, but only one effect can be used at a time, so it pays to resample your sounds with effects processing to use more effects.Recording is also pretty easy. Once you've filled the unit up with all your samples, they are available via the pads labelled 1 - 16. Like the VS-880, arm any of the four tracks you want to record to. Hit Record and trigger samples from the sample pads, add effects, adjust levels and do some panning. Songs can be recorded in real time or step time. The multi-track section has some nifty features of its own to make it quick and easy to use.The SP-808EX (e-Mix Studio) has a virtual monophonic synthesizer for use with the step-sequencer and D-Beams. It also has new vocal and guitar multi-effects, a 10-band vocoder, Voice Transformer and Mic Simulator, plus dozens of DJ-oriented groove effects. A larger 250MB Zip drive replaces the original 100MB Zip for expanded sampling/multi-track recording time, up to 61 stereo minutes, compressed. Expansion options include the OP-1 interface (6 analog outs, 2 digital I/Os, SCSI) or OP-2 interface (XLR I/Os, digital I/O, SCSI).

sound.Aside from the 10-band vocoder, the VP-330 added a string synth section,
choir and a human-voice sound, both of which are quite excellent
themselves. Its 3 sound sections offer a few different presets that can
be slightly edited with de-tuning and vibrato. The VP-330 is one of the

It's a beautiful
semi-modular monophonic synth consisting of 5 module components: the
Synthesizer 101, Expander 102, Mixer 103, Sequencer 104, and
Monitor Speakers 109. The Synthesizer 101 section is the heart of the
system, from which you could add-on any of the other modules of your
choice. Different combinations of these components can be used to create
systems of varying potential.The Synthesizer 101 section is a fully self-contained analog
mono-synth. It features a 37-note keyboard (with no performance controls,
velocity or aftertouch), and lots of sliders to tweak. Its design is
similar to the SH-series analog synths. Controls for the VCO, LFO,
VCF lowpass/highpass filters, VCA with ADSR, Noise, and Portamento/Glide
effects are all within hands reach. There's also a handy A-440Hz tuning
oscillator, like on the Minimoog.The Expander 102 section is a keyboard-less version of the 101,
designed to stand upright and behind the main Synthesizer 101.
More than one Expander 102 can be added to make your system fatter
and fatter! The Expander is identical to the Synthesizer except that it
replaces Portamento/Glide effects with a Sample-and-Hold feature for the
LFO, the Noise gen. is replaced by a Ring Modulator, and the A-440
tuning osc. is replaced by weak/strong sync inputs and a mix-in jack.
The Expander is an excellent way to add more oscillators and synth
effects (the s&h and ring-mod) to a System 100. The oscillators can be
synced if you have both modules. The 101 & 102 are already
internally patched and ready to produce sounds, but that can be bypassed
by external patching.The Mixer 103 is a cool add-on. Features 4 inputs and 4 sliders,
and mixes these down to 2 outputs. There are two analog VU meters (a
nice touch) as well as panning, mono effect sends/returns, and a
built-in spring reverb! The Model 103 is designed to sit on the right
side of the System and feeds the Monitor Speakers. The speakers
provide a stereo monitoring source which is another great (optional)
touch! The Mixer not only has outputs for these speakers, but also
Line-Outs for use live or in the studio! On the left side of the System
sits the Sequencer 104. This analog sequencer can be used to drive
your System with a 12x2 step pattern sequencer. It features variable
gate time, series or parallel modes, Start, Stop, Continue, and Step
buttons.The System 100 is a great sounding analog system with the classic
vintage Roland sound. Although it is itself an impressive system, Roland
took the concept a step further developing additional modules for the System 100m. Although the 100m has greater
patching freedom, it doesn't sound as warm as the 100. Apparently the
100 has the same filter chip as a TB-303, but it
certainly doesn't produce the same sound, the System 100 sounds better!

warm, and useable machines!It is used  by Orbital, Vince Clarke, Aphex Twin, BBC Radiophonic

to pick and choose to design a custom modular set-up. The Main unit is the M-110 which
has a single VCO oscillator, VCF, and VCA section. You can then build upon this
system adding any number and configurations of the various other modules which include
dual VCOs, ring modulators, dual VCFs, eq, dual VCAs, dual envelopes, LFOs, 
various effects, mixers, sequencers, and control interfaces including 3 different
keyboard controllers. Modules are assembled into racks. The System 100m has 3 rack sizes, the
M-190 holds 3 modules, the M-191 and M-191J hold 5 modules. Each rack
provides the necessary 8-pin DIN power connectors and internal CV/gate
connections between the modules. You still need to do some external patching, however, to
send your signal through the modules of your choice to create any sounds.
As for sounds, the System is basically monophonic, unless you get several racks
of them for lots and lots of money! Its sound is not as warm as the System 100 before it,
but it offers much more capability, as seen in Hans Zimmer's system below!Hans Zimmer's massive System 100m, image and info courtesy of Kevin Lightner.

It's a
monophonic analog bass synthesizer married to a pattern-based step
sequencer released in 1982. It features a single analog oscillator with
two waveforms (ramp or square) and has a simple but excellent VCF (filter)
with resonance, cut-off, and envelope controls. There are also knobs to
adjust tuning, envelope decay, tempo and accent amount.How does it work? Well, it's not a performance synthesizer because you
have to program a pattern of notes and timing info into it (sort of
like a drum machine). Patterns can then be linked into songs. It was
originally made to accompany a drum machine, the TR-606
specifically, and provide bass-line accompaniment to guitarists,
keyboard players, etc. It was not a successful product in its time. As
a result, creative DJs and aspiring electronic musicians found them for
next to no money and began using them for techno and acid music.
Usually a single pattern is continuously played while the performer
tweaks the knobs creating an exciting and expressive musical event.The TB-303 has become one of the most sought after vintage
synths ever! It has helped develop and stylize many forms of electronic
music including House, Acid, Trance and Ambient. If ever there was a
need for a repetitive bassline/groove or an extremely resonant and
bubbly sound, the 303 is KING. Truly a unique machine with a very
identifiable sound! It has spun off several imitators as well: Novation
Bass Station, ReBirth, Doepfer MS-404, MAM MB-33, Syntecno TeeBee, and
more (see Related & Alternative Gear sidebar).Ironically, these days it's become trendy to dislike the 303 again, now
because of over-use. But I don't and you shouldn't either because it is
one-of-a-kind and it's just got that sound that everyone loves! Fatboy
Slim says it best in his song ""Everybody Needs A 303!""Getting creative with the 303 always leads to great sounds! Add a guitar
distortion pedal for instant hard-core acid and techno. Use the CV and
Gate outputs to control other old synthesizers and get that elastic 303
groove workin' your other synths (especially cool with a polyphonic
synth). It is used by: Aphex Twin, 808 State, Future Sound of London,
Massive Attack, Orbital, Eat
Static, Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim),
Air, Astral Projection, Josh Wink, Plastikman, Überzone, Moby, Hardfloor, Ultramarine,
Underworld, BT, The Prodigy, Jimmy Edgar, Union
Jack, Front Line Assembly, Pet Shop Boys, Freddy Fresh, Luke Vibert, and
the Chemical Brothers.There are some custom modifications for the TB-303 which are definitely
worth mentioning here:TB-303 Devil Fish ModGet all the acid you can squeeze out of your TB-303 with the Devil Fish
modification, designed to enhance and extend the range of the 303's
filters and sound. Drastic, subtle and flexible modifications retain the
mild-mannered TB-303 sound capabilities, and create a completely new
instrument. The Devil Fish modification was created and is available from
Robin Whittle in Australia. More information is available at the TB-303
Devil Fish web site. See the YouTube links for a video demonstration.TB-303 Borg ModThe Borg TB-303 upgrade / modification - similar in many ways to the
Devil Fish but with advantages. This is a major upgrade available for the

greater creativity and flexibility in creating new sounds and live
performance. See the YouTube links for a video demonstration.",

machine to come from Roland, and it was also the precursor to the more
famous CR-line of CompuRhythm drum machines that would come out of
Roland five years later. The TR-66, however, is not truly a drum
machine—it is a rhythm arranger, just like it says on the front! There
are 18 initial drum patterns using kick, snare and hihat sounds arranged
into several rock, swing, march and dance patterns. These patterns could
then be combined with one (or more) of the 9 stylized rhythm patterns selected by
the buttons along the bottom row of the TR-66. These included Waltz,
Cha-Cha, Bossa Nova, Rhumba, etc. Two or more rhythm pattern buttons can
be pressed simultaneously for more unique combinations. All 27 patterns
also have an A/B/Auto variation mode. There are literally hundreds of
possible rhythm arrangements!Sonically, the TR-66 is a classic. All of its 11 sounds are pure
analog. They’re nothing too fancy, but they have a soft and warm
sound quality reminiscent of what was later found in the CR-series. The sounds include
kick, snare, hihat, conga, bongos, claves, maracas, cowbell, rim shot,
and cymbal. There’s no sound edit ability, however, other than the
“Balance” knob which acts like an overall tone control. Tempo can be
roughly adjusted—there is a giant knob with “Slow” to “Fast”
indicators on it—the tempo range covers 50 to 200 bpm. With
only a Start Switch input in the rear, there is no hope of actually synchronizing
the TR-66 to any other equipment in your studio (without modifying
it).The TR-66 probably offers little use to modern day music production,
practically speaking. The inability to synchronize it means that if
anybody wants to use its Rhythm Arrangements, and many still do, the
strategy is often to sample it, and work with the sampled loops
inside your DAW. Of course, that also means there are plenty of
pre-sampled TR-66 loops out there so musicians can easily get TR-66
sounds without ever owning one. Actual units are more often collected,
sampled by their owners, and otherwise shown off as a display piece of a
classic Roland instrument that came before its more famous CR-series and
TR-series descendants.The TR-66 has been used by Depeche Mode and Roxy Music.",

The TR-808 has become the signature beatbox used in most R&B and

of the sounds can be edited. Bass Drum and Cymbal (tone, decay), Snare (tone, snappy), 
Toms and Congas (tuning), Open Hat (decay). All sounds have individual
volume controls and individual outputs.
Unfortunately it was not MIDI equipped but it did use Roland's DIN
Sync.The TR-808 was OK in its time—it just didn't sound like real drums.
When the Linn Drum machines appeared, the 808 seemed doomed. But its
unique sound and analog allure have allowed it to find a long-lasting home in many
forms of music. Ultimately, the 808 has become one of the more important and

The V-Synth combines multiple oscillator technologies, user sampling and new COSM filtering for incredibly dynamic new sounds. The user has realtime control of a waveform's pitch, time and formant plus a killer arpeggiator and a host of realtime controllers including the revolutionary TimeTrip Pad and twin D-Beam controllers. All this leads to sounds that can move, morph, evolve and sound totally unique. The V-Synth has dual oscillators that offer a choice of three different synthesis methods: analog modeling, PCM waveforms with user sampling, and external audio input processing--all with up to 24-voice polyphony. The PCM oscillator is powered by VariPhrase for complete sonic control. Choose from over 300 preset waveforms or sample your own. Then use the ""TimeTrip"" function to manipulate a waveform's time aspect in any way you wish. Slow it down to uncover rich moving harmonic content; speed it up to create high-speed tonal motion; freeze it at your favorite spot; or rewind it backward at any speed without changing pitch and formant, which can also be independently controlled. The Analog modeling offers several fat-sounding analog style waveforms. The third oscillator type is External Audio Processing, which lets you process any signal arriving at the V-Synth's analog inputs. All three oscillator types can be layered and mixed in several ways, or modulated using FM, ring mod and oscillator hard sync.All programming is achieved via the large LCD Touch Screen plus a bunch of hands-on controls and knobs including the new TimeTrip Pad, twin D Beams and the velocity/aftertouch sensitive 61-note keyboard. While you can independently manipulate the pitch, time and formant of sampled waveforms using VariPhrase technology there is also powerful COSM processing offering analog-style filter modeling, a resonator and Side Band Filter, plus global reverb, chorus and multi-effects. The V-Synth's programmable arpeggiator can modulate sound parameters to provides additional rhythmic and timbral controls.The V-Synth is fully suited to the modern day studio as well, with analog I/O and MIDI ports supplemented by USB and digital S/PDIF I/O ports. Use the analog or digital inputs to sample your own waveforms to be used in the variable oscillator. You can even exchange .WAV and AIFF files via the built-in USB port, which also works for MIDI. Resampling is also possible, allowing users to capture any performance with the TimeTrip Pad, D Beam or arpeggiator - or even effected sounds - as an entirely new waveform. All Preset Patches are fully re-writeable, giving users plenty of space for their own creations, which can also be saved via USB to a computer or to an optional PC card. With PC card adapters, other media such as CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MicroDrives can also be used.Additionally, with V-LINK Onboard Video Control users are allowed playback and performance of video clips with music created on the V-Synth via the Roland DV-7PR Digital Video Workstation (sold separately). Use V-LINK to trigger different video clips with V-Synth's keyboard while using the bender to change playback speed. Using the TimeTrip Pad, you can scan a clip forwards or backwards with your finger, or change colors using the Twin D Beams. A totally unique feature perfectly suited for live use. The V-Synth GT was later released in 2007 which adds Roland's Vocal Designer technology with revolutionary Articulative Phrase Synthesis technology. Articulative Phrase synthesis recreates the ever-changing behavior, nuance and sound of an instrument as it's being played. The results are stunningly expressive and realistic, and can be applied to acoustic instrument simulation as well as new, never-before-heard sounds. In a nutshell, it lets acoustic instrument sounds such as a violin sound like it's being played with a bow rather than keys on a keyboard. New front panel features include a color touch-screen with eight universal control knobs, and the addition of dedicated buttons and sliders to make access faster and easier. The GT could also has a maximum 28 voices of polyphony.  The V-Synth XT is a rack-mount module version of the V-Synth released in 2005. Same amazingly powerful synthesis engine, minus some of the on-board perfomance controllers like the D-Beams and Trip Pad. However the large user touch screen is still fully represented.

traditional vocoder or harmonizer, the VP-550 uses Roland's breakthrough
vocal-modeling technology to bring the highest-quality, interactive
vocal sounds to a dedicated instrument. It literally lets you create a virtual
choir, solo or background vocal track using your own voice. Connect a mic, select a sound,
and play. The VP-550 generates expressive, interactive vocals in
real time, like classical choirs, soulful gospel choirs, pop and jazz
voices, male & female ensembles, vintage vocoders, and lush string/vocal
hybrids.The instrument is actually quite simple to use. It features two main
sections: Vocal Designer and Ensemble. In the Vocal Designer you can
select from solo or lead vocal types including: Classic, Male/Female, Gospel, Pop or Vocoder 1 and 2. This
section allows you to create stunning virtual vocals modeled from your
own voice. Can't sing? No problem, choose a voice type and play the
keyboard and your words will come out in tune! The vocoders offer
classic sounding robo-vocoder effects too. The Ensemble section lets you
select Strings 1 or 2, Jazz Scat, Mixed Chorus, Boys Choir or Humming.
The Ensemble section makes it possible to sound like a larger group of
singers (or like singing strings). You can even play Vocal Designer and
Ensemble sounds simultaneously.Every feature has a dedicated button or slider that's clearly labeled
and easy to reach. A little Ambience can be dialed in with a simple
Depth control (choose from one of three reverb types). An on-board
D-Beam controller in addition to the pitch bend & mod wheels gives you
plenty of options for performance effects. The D-Beam can be set to
modulate the filter, pitch or expression. The microphone input is XLR
type and there is also a 1/4-inch external input jack (for
vocoding). Other features include a basic Bass & Percussion section
and a Sound Check function that records the output signal for 10 seconds
and plays it back.The early vocoders, like their synthesizer counterparts, may not have
been very successful in their original design concept--synthetically
recreating the human voice or acoustic instruments--but because they had
a unique sound all their own, they became famous for their effect. The
VP-550 seems to break out of that box, and finally do what the original
concept of vocoding was intended to achieve. Rather than create a neat
robo-sound, the VP-550 is truly a vocal processor and synthesizer that
uses your voice to create stunning virtual vocals. With the VP-550, it's
more than just a cool effect, it really is a Vocal & Ensemble
Keyboard!",

instruments, Roland released the VP-550
in 2006, and three years later the VP-770, to keep the spirit of its 30
year-old predecessor, the legendary VP-330
Vocoder keyboard alive and well.The original VP-330 can be considered a ""sing and play"" vocoder,
where the user doesn't need to have a deep knowledge of vocoders or
synthesis. The strategy was very simple: Build a well tempered vocoder
with very few options to adjust, add a good ensemble section to be used
as the carrier and boost the dynamic between the mic input and formant
section and it's instant ""Mr. Roboto"". The VP-770 is built with the
same concept. It has a vocoder section called the Vocal Designer, an
independent Ensemble section and some other useful features, enclosed in
an elegant design with vintage-era inspired wooden side panels.The main feature of this instrument is the Vocal Designer. The VP-770
is built around a vocoder which has no directly user modifiable
parameters. Instead, the VP-770 analyses incoming vocal audio to create
harmonies, vocal textures and vocoder effects. The user simply selects a
Vocal Design: Classic, Male & Female, Gospel, Pop, Background or
Vocoder. Of course this instrument would be much more attractive if it
offered the ability to really tweak and experiment with the vocoding
parameters found in other vocoding instruments. Nevertheless, in
combination with the selected carrier sounds, the choral-based designs
are really impressive.The Vocal Designer offers 27 programs divided among the
aforementioned designs. Eleven of those programs are dedicated to the
Vocoder design, classified into 4 groups: Modern (which are monophonic
for typical talk-box effects), Vocoder, Vintage, and WahVox.The sources for the Formant (analysis section) can be switched
between the external mic input, USB Flash Memory, the Ensemble section
or the Sound Looper Function. For the external mic input, a dedicated
Effects section offers a noise supressor, a parametric equalizer and a
compressor, all of which are essential features to help contour incoming
audio.Another big feature of the Vocal Designer is Auto Harmony, which can
be used to add backing vocals to your vocal, for example. It offers the
harmonizer features Duet, Trio (upper and lower), Quartet, Manhattan and
Jazz-Open. Not sure about your own vocal skills? Pressing the the Auto
Note button will correct the pitch of the incoming audio to the nearest
note in either a chromatic or key-assignable diatonic mode, similar to
the well known Auto-Tune. Watch keyboardist Don Lewis
use the Auto Harmony feature.The edit menu for the Vocal Designer offers access to settings for
the carrier signal like Level, Pan, Tune, Octave, Tone, Attack, Release,
Bend, etc. For direct sound manipulation, Tone and Release sliders are
all that is available in this section.The Ensemble section offers the second timbrality of the VP-770 and
can be thought of as a separate synth module containing typical keyboard
sounds with some variation capabilities via the Tone and Attack sliders
and the usual rompler settings accesible through the Edit menu
for this section. The Ensemble section is divided into several
categories: Strings, (SuperNatural) Brass, Guitar, Others, Pad, Synth
Strings, Choir and Jazz Scat. A Voice Expression switch allows the
external input to modulate the level of the ensemble. Watch keyboardist Jordan
Rudess use this feature (and the SuperNatural Brass patch).The Bass and Percussion section is the third timbrality of the VP-770
and offers nine typical bass sounds in the categories: Voice, Reso,
Compu, Analog and Spike. The percussion contains only one vocal
percussion set. If this section is active, the keyboard is split with
the bass or perc mapped to the lower register. Standard drum sounds/sets
are not implemented.The Sound Looper Function is a phrase-loop sequencer that allows the
incremental audio recording (and playback) of any sound coming out of
the VP-770 to create a fast accompaniment pattern. The record duration
is 18 seconds and offers basic settings like Beat, Tempo, Length,
Auto-Trigger and Metronome.The only on-board effect is Ambience which offers two types of hall
and one studio reverb, with a dedicated knob to adjust the depth. There
is also a Vibrato effect with three dedicated knobs to adjust the Rate,
Delay Time and Depth. The VP-770 offers Roland's D-Beam controller
which can be assigned to modulate the Pitch, Filter or Expression. Two
buttons (S1 and S2) located near the Pitch Bend can be assigned to
activate different functions such as Pizzicato and Tremolo for the
String section, or Staccato and Fall for the Brass section.The included Audio Key Utility (PC software) allows you to load WAV,
AIFF and MP3 audio files via USB Flash Memory, assign them to the lower
octave keys and define their play mode (one shot, loop, immediate or
wait). You can also backup presets, Sound Looper phrases and system data
to USB Flash Memory.Musicians without prior vocoder experience will find immediate
results with the VP-770. Most impressive are its choral sounds, opening
new possibilities to players who would like to have more than their own
solo voice for a vocal part. However, like most of Roland's re-launched
and resurrected model lines, the VP-770 is no replacement for the
original. It has a very modern and digital sound that may be perfect for
some users and styles of music, just as the original VP-330's unique
sound and analog character may be preferred for certain styles and users
as well. The VP-770 is a highly polished and well conceived Vocal
Processing instrument designed to give keyboardists a lot of voice with
little fuss, and in that way it does carry the VP-series spirit.",

It is a sampler capable of elastic realtime manipulation of pitch, time, and
formants via MIDI while maintaining superb sound quality. With the VP-9000
you can instantly match drum loops to the same key and tempo. Or use it to bend
notes, change pitches or harmonize and more! It all works in real-time with little
artifacts and in a non-destructive environment. Thankfully, the VP-9000 features
three large knobs for realtime control over pitch, time, formant, and groove right
on the front of the module for realtime tweaking!The VP-9000 comes with 8MB memory which is expandable to 136MB using optional SIMMs.
The VP-9000 is a professional equipped with six analog outputs plus digital I/O in coaxial 
and optical formats; two SCSI ports for connecting hard drives, Zip drives, and CD-ROM's;
internal 250MB Zip drive for storing samples and transferring files to a Mac or PC.
There are superb effects built-in as well-reverb, chorus, and multi-effects.The VP-9000 also features a large icon-based graphic LCD screen for wave editing and 
simplified operation. Internal resampling capability is great for applying effects to samples
over and over, etc. The VP-9000 is also compatible with VP-9000/Roland S-700/Akai S1000/AIFF/.WAV 
format files for loading sample libraries. The VP-9000's only fault is a limited 6-voices
and 6-part multitimbrality. But this could be the best sampler/processor of all time and requires a listen!
It is used by Fatboy Slim.Although the initial operating system was known to have numerous bugs
(particularly causing crashes), the release of OS 1.12 fixed these
problems (The updated operating system is available from Roland's web
site at no charge). The price tag upon release was $3000, a hefty
investment considering there are sofware applications that can do
(almost) the same thing, but for traditional or electronic musicians
that need to take their loops\songs\samples on the road, or for a studio
musicians that enjoys a more hands on approach to beat syncronizing or
time stretching samples this unit is for you! This unit is also
responsible for the now passe 'robot' sound that has popularized popular
music as of late (ala Daft Punk, and most R&B artists). No other 
sampler in the market has the same unique features that the VP-9000 offers.And with the new V-Producer software package for Mac and PC-compatible you can
take full control of your VP-9000! It gives you fully intuitive and handsome graphic
interfaces for Phrase Scope Editing, drag-and-drop sequencing of Variphrase samples,
6-channel mixing and effects routing along with MIDI Clock and MTC sync, song export to Standard MIDI

It was one of the very first workstations that was self-contained and came with a large sample library included. For the W-30, Roland basically combined their S-550 sampler engine with their MRC sequencer and keyboard. This also explains why the W-30 is compatible with the sound libraries of their dedicated samplers, such as the S330, S550 and S50.

The W-30 came standard with a built-in 3.5"" floppy disk drive, but on the back panel you will also find a spot to fit it with the KW30 SCSI kit. This is a very rare piece of hardware that transformed the W30 into a SCSI Master device to drive compatible hard drives and CD-ROM players. Loading samples from a SCSI hard drive is obviously a lot faster, but the maximum usable capacity was limited to only 80 megabytes. Also on the back is MIDI, In, Out and Thru sockets, a footswitch and footpedal input, mono headphone socket and mono sample input with its associated gain knob.

When purchased new, the Roland W-30 came bundled together with four diskettes that contained the operating system along with demo sounds and songs. The system disk must be in the W-30 drive when starting it up, a process which can take about half a minute. If the disk is not present, the 8x40 character backlit blue LCD screen will display a message asking you to insert it.

Speaking of the screen, its contrast can be adjusted via a knob on the rear of the W30, and it looks a lot better than the one or two line LCD screens that was common back then. With more than 62 pages each that contain even more windows, it is a good thing that the W-30 has two infinite rotary dials to navigate everything. A set of five soft buttons can also be found below the screen and these can be used to jump directly to the pages you need as well as to adjust different functions depending on the currently selected page.

The W30 has 512Kword RAM, which means you can get just over 14 seconds of sampling at 30kHz sample rate out of it. It has features 512Kword of non-rewritable ROM, 32 RAM-using tones, 64 ROM-using tones and 16 patches. The W30 can be used in ""Performance"" mode for playing the keyboard, ""Sequencer"" mode, which is for recording data into the sequencer and ""Sound"" mode, which is for editing patches, tones and more. All three of these main modes also feature a number of sub modes.

Overall, the W-30 was quite popular for its time and musicians such as Liam Howlett from The Prodigy made extensive use of it on all their early tracks. It even remained his master keyboard on-stage until 2008. Some of the drawbacks of the W-30 is the lack of real time filters and the fact that it doesn't have Sysex.",

It's a digital synthesizer
that uses sampled sounds and waveforms stored on ROM chips. Basic envelope
and filter settings can be manipulated to tweak the sounds, but that's it. The
sounds themselves are preset and not very tweakable. Though its filter
is digital, it is resonant and sounds ok. There is also basic reverb and chorus effects.
However, the LCD display is narrow and programming can become tedious, if not boring
and the interface is often reported as being 'buggy'.However, its sounds can be anything but boring at times! Standard GM-set and SR-JV80 type sounds include
great acoustic instruments (pianos, strings, winds, percussion and brass) and a lot of
nice synth-type sounds (303 lines, sub bass, noise, leads, pads). It is quite capable of
creating dance music or symphonic performances.As a workstation, the XP-10 provides at least a starting point. It has an arpeggiator
with several preset patterns (but no user patterns).
There are two programmable sliders for real-time control of some of the editable 
parameters like the filter cutoff. Another feature called ""X-Dual"" mode layers
two sounds which can be panned and mixed independently to create a new sound.
Today, the XP-10 makes an ok back-up synth for quality but basic sounds, but it still 
leaves much to be desired.",

the Syntauri Corporation had the idea of forgoing the typical hardware
route and instead using a personal computer to handle its processing and
functionality.  Billed as the first affordable digital synth (around
$1,500, Apple IIe not included), the alphaSyntauri competed directly
against the Synclavier and
Fairlight systems (both about $40,000
more) and set an impressive standard for 1980.  It seemed to be most
popular in academic settings, where Apple II systems were already
commonplace, although it did make its way into a handful of professional
recordings.16 digital oscillators, 8-note stereo polyphony and 8-part
multitimbrality came courtesy of the Mountain Computer Music System dual
digital oscillator card that is the heart of the system.  The brains
come courtesy of an Apple IIe/II+ and lots of custom-written software. 
An external keyboard was available in 49 or 61 key sizes, the latter of
which was velocity-sensitive.  The primary performance software,
""alphaPlus"" provided access to 10 instruments, control over a
handful of parameters and could manage a keyboard split of two sounds as
well. The ""alphaPlus"" interface also included an odd visual
feedback effect of bars displayed on the monitor corresponding to the
keys being played.  The result was not unlike the light show in the
finale of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  It serves no
actual purpose but it looks neat. A 16-track sequencer called
""MetaTrak"" was also available that was multitimbral and quite
flexible. You could play live over an existing MetaTrak sequence. Third
party software included many music education titles, as well as some
pretty impressive visual wave editing programs.The sound is fiercely, aggressively digital, a premonition of the first
Ensoniq instruments to come a half-dozen years later, thanks to its
8-bit waveforms and utter lack of any analog processing.  The upside was
that with the right software you could actually draw your own waveforms,
making it something akin to a simple sample-playback unit.  While the
included instruments and presets are wretched, with patience you can get
some mean, cutting lead tones and some serviceable organs out of it.Exactly why the alphaSyntauri sunk with little trace is unclear.  The
company, Syntauri Corporation, which folded in 1984, likely had many of
the management problems that did in its contemporaries.  And the
computer industry didn't sit still—by 1988, when the last vestige
of alphaSyntauri support vanished, the Apple II was old news.It is difficult to find an intact system these days.  The part most
commonly missing is the keyboard interface card, most likely forgotten
about when old Apple systems were discarded.  The keyboard controllers,
while fairly common, are useless without the interface card, and
precious few 20+ year old 5 1/4"" floppy disks are still readable. 
Your best bet is to find an intact system someone else already has,
otherwise be prepared for one heck of a scavenger hunt.Whether or not the hunt is worth it depends on your attitude towards the
sounds. The success of the Elektron Sid
Station suggests that there is a market for 8-bit grunginess,
particularly in the electronica realm. Though not terribly rare, the
alphaSyntauri is a fascinating piece of both synthesizer history and
computer history. It has been used by Herbie Hancock and Laurie
Spiegel.Alternatively, you can forego the trouble of locating all that ancient equipment
and get the alphaSyntauri for your modern computer/DAW
for just $59! Phosphor is a VST instrument from Audio Damage modeled on 
the alphaSyntauri. “Phosphor's topology
closely follows the alphaSyntauri, while adding many modern features
such as full velocity control, a much more extensive modulation
routing system, tempo synced LFOs, a pair of delays, and two
monophonic modes. The noise and oscillators are able to work in the
original alphaSyntauri resolutions, and can also be run at modern
sample rates. All this results in a much more sophisticated and
capable synth than the original, without compromising the ability to
recreate the classic sounds of the early days of digital
synthesis.”",

It wasn't until the Tempest hit stores in 2011 that a true analog drum synth became available. Meanwhile, Elektron shifted efforts from their expertise in sample-based and digital products to analog with the Analog Four. So the announcement of plans to release an analog drum machine in 2014 wasn't necessarily a surprise, but it was certainly welcomed with anticipation among the analog-hungry.Elektron have delivered not just an analog drum machine but a true analog drum synth. In some ways, it's similar in concept to the Roland 808 or 909. Each sound has its own engine and a 16-step sequencer. But this is 2014 so the capabilities go far beyond that--with an analog engine augmented by a sample slot for sonic territory that extends far beyond most analog boxes.Each sound is associated with a pad that you can play in real time and record with--quantized or not. The pads are much smaller than those on an MPC so they might take some getting used to. But they feel solid and are velocity-sensitive. The engine and available parameters of each sound depend on the sound. For example, the Bass Drum has 2 oscillators and ""snap"" and ""tick"" parameters while the Cymbal has 6 oscillators and a noise color parameter. In some ways that is limiting if compared to, say, the Tempest's carte blanche approach where each voice can be patched as desired. But Elektron's decision is true to the old school approach of voicing each sound differently, and it means that, unlike the Tempest, there is an analog noise source and up to 6 oscillators per voice. And the Rytm goes far beyond the limits of an old school drum machine; you can make your snare sound like a tom or like a glitchy insect with just a few parameter changes. If the analog engine still doesn't supply enough versatility, each sound supports one sample which can replace or be combined with the analog engine. The sampling capabilities are nothing like those of some of Elektron's other offerings. There's no way to see the waveform, for example, but the loop, bit rate, and other sound engine parameters do provide for a fair amount of versatility for something that's essentially an extra. There also aren't a lot of samples to choose from, but packs are available on the Elektron site as well as from other sources.Changing parameters is straightforward with a small but clear display screen. All voice parameters are edited with soft encoders which are fluid and show no signs of stepping. Each parameter page (Synth, Sample, Filter, Amp, LFO) is easy to navigate with only a few esoteric abbreviations due to space constraints. The global FX pages work in the same way and use a bus on each sound's amp page for each sound to share the respective effect or be left completely dry. Sounds are saved in kits, and with memory for 128 projects and 128 kits per project, storage shouldn't be an issue. But the USB port should help with backup, as well as loading samples.Sound-wise the Analog Rytm can tend to be modern, and the DCOs don't have the organic feel of an 808, for example. The sound tends to be a bit clean--until you start adding some overdrive to your sound. The overdrive is before the filter and beefs up the sound source to really get more aggressiveness from the filter. If that's still not enough, even just a hint of distortion adds enough harmonics to make a track as old school or grungy as you want. And being able to get that sound as well as a fully compressed version of it out of one box is a delight. There is an audio output per voice but the stereo outs are often all one would need for a fully realized, properly compressed drum track.Some drum machines are intended more as real-time performance tools, other as studio tools to be programmed. This is a machine that can be straight-up sequence-and-hit-play or a hands-on performance tool. The 16-step sequencer will be familiar to users of old school gear or simulations of it. The steps can be extended to 64 steps, various time signatures are supported, and swing levels add a looseness not found on those old units. The Rytm can also be set up to record the beats tapped out on the pads in real-time. Copying/pasting make programming that much simpler.For more set-and-forget studio magic, Elektron has integrated parameter locks (a.k.a. P-locks), which allow the user to tweak a parameter and record the value which is locked for that step. So you can have a low tom be a high tom on just one step of the sequence--or bring in delay just for one beat, etc. Adding even more versatility, there's sound lock which lets you swap one sound for another for the step you choose. Finally, parameter slide lets you lock in some organic glisses and glitches.For those more into performing rather than programming, there are modes to choose from to enhance your song. Mute mode lets you mute sounds on the fly. Chromatic mode lets you play the pads as a keyboard--providing there are oscillators or samples that support that--and you can even get some decent bass or lead tones. Two more expressive modes are Performance and Scene. Performance allows control over multiple parameters by pressing a pad harder or softer. Scene mode is a set of 12 scenes each of which is a collection of parameter locks. Performance and Scene modes take a bit of planning and setting up but they are well worth it for a dynamic performance.In addition to all of the onboard features, Elektron has announced Overbridge, which promises to integrate the Analog Rytm with your DAW, support bi-directional audio streaming, and allow full VST control.All in all, the Analog Rytm sounds and feels like exactly what it is--an analog voice with a digital brain. Classic electronic drum sounds are in there along with new analog drum sounds to be discovered. The digital brain not only makes it a suitable center for a modern studio, it also gives it the sonic and functional flexibility of a contemporary drum machine.",

It can synthesize wonderfully convincing analog sounds from the classic
drum machines as well as crisp electronic and acoustic drum sounds,
and they can all be tweaked and morphed into unique and dynamic new sounds!
It has 39 drum sounds ready to be played or tweaked and customized by you!
Its eight real-time control knobs offer total hands-on synthesis
and control.At the core of the Machinedrum are four separate percussion instrument synthesizers. They include a
TRX synth that emulates Roland's classic TR-series drum machines.
An EFM synth that uses FM synthesis to create crispy percussion sounds. The
E12 synth is a sample-playback synth using sounds from the E-mu SP1200
and Simmons electronic drum machines. The PI synth uses physical models
of acoustic drums for realistic acoustic drums. Each of these synth engines give you excellent
quality drum sounds and you can mix and match sounds from all of them
among the 16-voice polyphonic drumkits. Your custom 'Kits' can be
saved in any of the 64 memory locations. This will also store any custom
tweaks you made to the individual drum sounds in each of your kits.Drum editing features include amplitude modulation, a 1-band EQ,
multimode resonant filter, distortion, sample-rate reducer and effects
(delay, reverb). All of these parameters are available on
each drum sound independently for total control of each sound in your
kit! There's also a compressor and 3-band EQ to process the overall mix.
Stereo plus four assignable outputs give you plenty options where
to send your sounds and the stereo inputs let you trigger drum sounds or process
external sounds as a drum voice.The built-in sequencer offers two programming methods: Classic and Extended.
Classic is a pretty limited mode. It works like the classic TR-series in
which you assign a drum tone to a 'step' in the pattern using the 16
buttons along the bottom of the instrument. You can store your patterns
but the 'Kit' associated with it and any tweaks you do are not stored. Extended mode
is more in-depth and stores 'Kit' info with patterns. Extended mode has real and
step (grid) time editing, supports odd time signatures, and patterns can have up to 32 steps.
Also on-board is an Accent assignable to any step with 15 levels of intensity,
and continuously variable swing and slide, assignable to the whole pattern or individual steps within the pattern.MIDI is fully implemented and can control the sequencer and synthesizer 
functions of the Machinedrum. Trigger sounds or entire patterns synced
to MIDI clock. All edit parameters can be controlled by continuous MIDI controller numbers.
This machine has it all, giving you total control and the flexibility to create
your own unique drum sounds across a wide range of sonic percussion possibilities!",

multitimbral capability which allows for up to 6 mono-synth sounds at
once, or a single 6-voice polyphonic sound.The SuperWave synthesizer, which is analog modeled, gives warm and thick
sounds made from unique algorithms that makes sounds free from the
artifacts normally associated with digital processing. Traditional (and
303-like) saw and pulse waveforms and sub-oscillators give you fat bass
synth and lead sounds, while the ensemble is specialized in creating

high quality synthesis, complete with ring-mod and sync. Just like the
original, the oscillators are derived from an extremely fast main
counter, giving the crisp highly recognizable sound.DigiPRO offers raw digital waveforms, which can be put into animated
life. The BeatBox, which is a part of DigiPRO, offers a percussive
toolbox shaped in the traditions of the Machinedrum E12 synth. The
sounds of DigiPRO WAVE are harsh and electric and stand out in the mix.FM+ is 21st century FM synthesis. It implements world class frequency
modulation algorithms that address the complexity problem normally
associated with FM. All three FM+ machines are based around a number of
custom made FM blocks. The machines have been handcrafted, each
with its own personality.VO is inspired by classic voice modeling methods using formant
synthesis. The goal was not to recreate any existing voice or speech
synthesizer, but to create a new way of building and controlling a
synthetic voice in a way that suits musicians. VO-6 is the VO
incarnation of the Monomachine. User controllable between
pulse or white noise, formant filters and a set of predefined
consonant-like sounds.While the Monomachine's 6-part beat-box-style sequencer can be used to
create your own synth grooves, it offers six additional MIDI tracks that
can be used for controlling external MIDI gear. MIDI control data can be
generated realtime, with parameter locks and with LFOs. Each MIDI track
offers a full implementation of the Monomachine arpeggiator.Monomachine SFX-6The SFX-6 is a limited edition of the original SFX-60, with an

Editing and creating your sounds would be done as if you were sitting in
front of the real thing. The obvious changes can be found hidden away
behind the faux speaker grilles - the addition of Chorus and Delay
effects and an array of four tracking generators for creating custom,
tempo-synced LFOs. Actually put the ARP 2600V up against a real 2600 and
you'll notice many more differences between the two. The three VCO's can
now be switched to operate as LFO's, and MIDI sync switches can be found
around the sample-and-hold, LFO and sequencer sections. The original's
single lowpass filter is replaced by a multi-mode filter with plenty of
options. There is a 24 dB lowpass modeled after the 1st generation of
ARP synthesizers (known as the 4012 filter). There is a 24 dB low pass
modeled after the 2nd generation (known as the 4072 filter). And there
is a 12 dB multimode from the ARP 2500
with high, low, band pass and notch filtering. They all sound ARP-like,
are resonant and can self-oscillate.As for the sound, well it sounds amazing! It is definitely ARP-like, but
is nowhere near as authentic as TimewARP
2600. But it still sounds amazingly warm and rich as a virtual
analog modular synthesizer. It ships with over 400 presets created by
various artists covering everything from throbbing basses to rhythmic
textures and pad sweeps. Creating your own sounds is challenging, but
worth it. If you can program the real thing, you'll feel right at home
patching up sounds in the 2600V. Otherwise, this plug-in is a great
teaching tool for newbies to modular synthesis. The virtual patch cords
will wiggle out of the way of your mouse as you move around the
interface making the 2600V feel like it's alive! And the 16-step analog
sequencer is pure old-school and really the easiest way to create your
own simple sequences and arpeggio patterns.Those who know the history of the 2600 know it's been through many
revisions. Pictured above are alternative ""skins"" for the interface to
replicate the blue and grey ""meanies"" and the orange-on-black paint
schemes, but there are no sonic differences. No matter which skin you
choose, you'll have probably the most versatile and powerful modular
synthesizer with sparkling sound quality (96kHz, 64-bit) ready to bring
your music to life! It may not sound as authentic as the TimewARP 2600,
but it's still a brilliant soft-synth with its own classic sound and
dazzlingly nostalgic interface!",

and coveted by some of music's greatest players and synthesists since
the 1970's. That synth, almost impossible to find and afford in stable
working condition these days, is known as the Yamaha CS-80. It was
Yamaha's flagship polyphonic analog synthesizer during it's hey-day, and
now it can be yours thanks to Arturia. Arturia has developed ""TAE"" -
""True Analog Emulation"" which they have employed in their Minimoog V and
Moog Modular V software synthesizers and now, in the CS-80V as well. The
CS-80V is available for Mac or PC and is compatible with all major
formats (VST, DXi, Audio Units, MAS, RTAS, HTDM, and more).The CS-80V is a brilliant and faithful recreation of the original CS-80
in looks and sound, with a few welcome additions that make the CS-80V
even better than the original, and at only a mere fraction of the
CS-80's original and current second-hand prices! Some of these new
features include additional LFO's, an Arpeggiator, Stereo Delay, a
flexible Modulation Matrix, and most importantly - MIDI Sync options!
Arturia's ""TAE"" sounds wonderful and the CS-80V sounds very warm and
analog. Visually, the CS-80V is very large (1024x768 resolution
needed) but beautifully recreates the front panel of the original CS-80,
complete with 61-note keyboard, ribbon controller; it even has virtual
built-in spinning fans which are an instant turn-on for any software
synth freak!The original CS-80 had a unique synth architecture in that it was basically two
discrete 8-voice polyphonic synths. A quick glance at the front panel shows two rows of
identical sets of controls and sliders for Signal Paths I & II. Each
Signal Path has a single oscillator, high and lowpass filters, a VCA
section and keyboard velocity/aftertouch response controls. Each Path
also features independent noise generators and LFO mode selectors. The
two Signal Paths can be layered or played individually. A few basic effects including Ring Modulation, Tremolo,
and Chorus can be applied globally to both Signal Paths.The Oscillator (VCO) section offers six waveforms (sine, saw up, saw down,
square, noise, and random) and adjustable Pulse-Width Modulation and
Noise level. The Oscillator can be modulated by the LFO in one of three
modes: free, triggered, or mono. The LFO triggering can also be sync'd
to MIDI for each Signal Path. The two
oscillator sections can be ""Linked"" so adjusting one's settings affects
both the same, and they can be sync'd together as in the traditional sense of
oscillator sync.The VCF (filter) section is unique and very rich. There are switchable 12
or 24dB/oct highpass and lowpass filters available in series (one after the
other) with adjustable Cutoff and Resonance controls. The Highpass and Lowpass filters
can be individually turned on and off. There are also Level, Attack,
Decay, and Release envelope controls for the filter. The VCA section
offers standard Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release envelope controls as
well as VCF and VCA Level sliders.Then we get to the global
controls that affect both Signal Paths. For an LFO, the original
CS-80 had just a simple triangle wave sub-oscillator. The new CS-80V
employs an LFO with the same waveform shapes as the VCO's (note: the LFO
is labelled as the Sub-Oscillator on both the CS-80 and CS-80V). The LFO
is simultaneously assignable to the VCO, VCF and VCA sections! The Ring
Modulator section offers adjustable Attack, Decay, Depth, Speed, and Mod
controls. To the left of the keyboard is the effects section: Chorus and
Tremolo as well as performance effects such as Portamento and Glissando
are all here. The new addition of a stereo Delay with MIDI sync
capability is a great enhancement. An Arpeggiator has also been added to
the CS-80V (similar to that in the Minimoog V) with MIDI sync as well as
adjustable speed and Up, Down, Up/Down, Random, and Notes played
patterns adjustable over a 4-octave range and with up to 4 repeats (# of
repeats before moving pattern to next octave). There are also Transpose
sliders for each oscillator, global ""Brilliance"" and ""Resonance"" and Osc
1+2 Mix controls, keyboard touch response controls, and the original's
cool Ribbon Controller for pitch bending.Under the hood are a few major upgrades that really bring the CS-80 into 
the 21st century! The original CS-80 had its VCO-VCF-VCA signal flow 
diagramed on it's front panel where it housed its preset programming section. 
Pop it open on the CS-80V to reveal the Modulation Matrix.
Here you can route up to 10 different sources (LFOs, Envelope Generators, Ribbon Controller, etc.) to modulate 
almost any of the CS-80V's synth parameters. This just gives you tremendous flexibility
that the original never offered. Speaking of upgrades, the memory on the original
was severely limited, but the CS-80V has virtually unlimited patch storage,
and ships with over 400 patches designed by famous artists (Bass, EFX, Leads,
Pads, Horns, Ambient, Sequences, Percussion, Keyboards, Guitars, Organs, Strings,
and more). Finally, a Voice Control section
allows you to control each of it's eight voices independently! Each voice
can be assigned to 1 of 4 keyboard zones or turned off, transposed, de-tuned, panned,
mixed, and more! They can also be assigned to up to 4 different MIDI channels
for multitimbral use, and even different patches can be assigned to each
voice so you can cycle through patches as you play! All of these flexible and functional
new features integrate seamlessly into the CS-80V's design, and are simple enough
to navigate and use. Arturia's CS-80V is a must have software synth for anyone looking for
a very warm and very classic analog sound. Everything about the original CS-80,
even its quirks are recreated here with stunning detail and sonic quality. 
Few software synthesizers offer such warm analog sounds as well as
the chance to learn about the unique and classic instrument that put Yamaha
on the map of analog synthesizers.",

soft-synth maker, Arturia. It is the first virtual analog replica of
Roland's venerable Jupiter 8, a truly classic and highly sought after
flagship polysynth from Roland's analog era, circa 1981-84. Arturia has
faithfully and beautifully recreated the look, feel and sound of the
original while at the same time adding many modern features and all at a
very reasonable price.The Jupiter-8V is a stand-alone, VST, RTAS and Audio Unit compatible
software synthesizer utilizing Arturia's trademark TAE (True Analog
Emulation) algorithm as the underlying architecture for its sound and
synthesis. Visually, you see an almost picture perfect
replica of the original Jupiter 8, with its fairly basic but
surprisingly flexible and sophisticated layout. Along the top of the
panel you have instantly familiar LFO, VCO, VCF, VCA and Envelope
controls. Below that, a row of colorful buttons allow selection of
Arpeggiators, Solo/Poly modes, keyboard modes, and patch selection - all
very similar to the classic original.So we know it looks the part, but does it sound the part? In a word,
YES! The original Jupiter 8 was made famous by countless 80's musicians
and superstars for its incredibly fat, sweet, lush, and clear synth
sounds that rivaled the competition of its time from other polysynths like
the Prophets and Oberheims. The Jupiter-8V proudly serves up over 400 high quality
sounds right out of the box, many of which were programmed by talented
sound designers & programmers. With so many sounds, Arturia have
thankfully implemented a filtering system allowing you to narrow
searches for sounds by Designer, Preset Type, Characteristics, Keyboard
Mode, and more. Right away you'll find awesome Bass, Brass, EFX, FM,
Guitar, Lead, Organ, Pad, Perc, Piano, Strings and more. The presets
cover a wide range from boring to awesome - it's all about personal
taste. But the real fun begins when you start to tweak your own sounds.
All controls can be set to ""Learn"" any MIDI control source so you can
tweak your favorite controls right from your MIDI controller.(Patch Selection Info & Filtering)Synthesis starts as a fairly basic affair, akin to the original synth.
There are two VCOs, each with independent waveform selectors (saw, ramp,
pulse or square) and range and tuning controls. A VCO Modulator lets you
modulate the PWM and VCO 1 or 2 (or both simultaneously) via the LFO and
Envelope 1 settings. The LFO offers four waves (sine, saw, square,
random). There's a VCF (filter) switchable between 12 or 24 dB/oct with
cutoff, resonance, Env mod, LFO mod and Kybd follow. There's also a
separate Hipass Filter with cutoff control. The two ADSR envelopes can
be used to shape and modulate the Oscillators and Filter. The
Arpeggiator offers Up, Down, Up/Down and Random modes over 4 octaves.
And the keyboard can be split or used in a Dual mode which is sort of
like having two presets in one! The Pitch Bender can be adjusted to bend and modulate
VCO pitch and/or VCF cutoff.(Effects Settings for a Stereo Reverb)Now, unlike the original Jup 8, the Jup 8V offers many new and welcome
modern features that take the sound possibilities to the next level. For
starters, patch storage is unlimited and instead of the 8 voices for
which the Jupiter is named, polyphony is increased to 32 voices. But the
biggest differences come from the new modulations and effects features.
Among the new effects, there are two Voice effects available within the
synthesis path including Chorus, Distortion, EQ, Phaser and Ring Mod.
This lets you run the VCO straight through some distortion, for example,
before the VCF (filter), and after the filter you can add another effect like EQ before
the signal reaches the VCA. Additionally there are another two Patch
effects that can be placed on the whole patch which includes
Chorus/Flanger, Delay, Dual Phaser and Reverb. All the available effects
have surprisingly flexible and complete parameters and settings for
creating very flexible effects that go miles beyond the original
capabilities of the original Jupiter.But the Jup-8V's flexibility goes even further with the Modulations
section which offers a Galaxy module, a live Step Sequencer module (sort
of like Reason's Matrix sequencer) and an advanced Keyboard module for
programming Velocity and Aftertouch effects. (Galaxy Modulation Settings)The Galaxy module is
fascinating. It lets you create a sort of evolving motion based on two
LFOs (free running or synced) moving in 2-D, the effect of which can be
assigned to up to 6 destinations (VCO pitches, PWM, VCF cutoffs, resonance
and VCA). With this you can create glistening pads and textures and effects that
move like no other Jupiter can do. (Live Step Sequencer)The Sequencer module offers 32 steps
per measure, and you can enter (or draw) which steps play certain notes,
and you can add accent and glide effects and the sequencer can trigger
up to 3 sources (VCO pitches, PWM, VCF cutoff, resonance or the VCA). (Keyboard Velocity and Aftertouch Settings)The
Keyboard module lets you adjust Velocity and Aftertouch curves and
assign them to up to 3 sources each (VCO pitches, PWM, VCF cutoff,
resonance or the VCA) for incredibly lively sounds at each press of the
key!Playing with the Jupiter-8V right out of the box, it instantly captures
the nostalgia and sonic history of the original Jupiter in a way that is
both exciting and inspiring. It is undoubtedly the cheaper and smarter
way to get your mitts on a Jupiter if those are the sounds you desire.
But delving deeper into Arturia's advanced modulation and effects
functions and all the other advanced features that make this a truly
modern software synthesizer make the Jupiter-8V a clear choice for
today's synth geeks looking for yesterdays sounds. But even those who
are not so desperate for an analog replica, the Jupiter-8V is so flexible
and sounds so wonderful that it will surely be a very useful and
effective tool in any software-based musician's arsenal. This is
definitely one of the best replicas and all around poly synths available
in the software synthesizer format.",

NAMM 2012 and in the electronic music world. Not only was it the first
new mass-market analog VCO synth in quite a while, it was also from a
company known for its soft synths. Highly affordable at a street price
of $499 and filled with great features, the (almost) all-analog synth
filled the desire for a new hands-on analog synth that could compete in
price and sound with the well-loved vintage synths. Smartly designed,
the unit can neatly fit into an all-vintage, modern MIDI, or modular
setting with its CV, USB and MIDI DIN connections. Built in an aluminum
body with rubber end caps, the MiniBrute is rugged, with only the knobs
feeling a bit on the wobbly side.Sonically, the MiniBrute is aggressive. Its tone can be tamed for softer
textures, but it seems to gravitate toward the raunchy, with its
""Brute Factor"" control adding rich distortion. The multimode
Steiner-Parker filter provides versatility beyond what most vintage
mono synths deliver. Taking things even further, Arturia provide
""Ultrasaw"" control over the saw waveform and
""Metalizer"" over the triangle wave, allowing the user to
create unique new sounds for a VCO mono synth. To make the sound even
larger, the MiniBrute's VCO wave mixer lets you combine the waveforms
with dedicated volume sliders per waveform, allowing for sounds similar
to a polyphonic synth's unison mode. Many of those who were initially
unconvinced by the single VCO were quickly swayed by the sonic
flexibility of the waveforms and the sub-oscillator.With a multimode arpeggiator, aftertouch, velocity-sensitivity,
multimode Steiner-Parker filter and many more features, the MiniBrute
has few vintage competitors in terms of functionality. And it also holds
its own in comparing its sound with that of beloved mono synths of
yesteryear, and it even goes beyond the limits of the architecture of
most 1970s subtractive synths, making the MiniBrute both a unique homage
to the past as well as a new and creative interpretation of it. No
menus, no presets. Just a straightforward, hands-on, ""knobby""
analog mono synth.",

The Minimoog V looks like the original Minimoog, and yes, it sounds like it too -  minus
the noise, instability and other problems associated with analog circuitry. Some may say that
is the very character desired in analog synthesizers, but you just can't knock a totally
pristine and clean Moog sound that's equally as fat as the original all the way
up to 96kHz and 24-bit digital quality in STEREO! The Minimoog V is a software instrument for Mac and PC
compatible with all standard formats (VST, DXi, Audio Units, MAS, RTAS, HTDM, and more).Upon first impression, the Minimoog V is big! It takes up a lot of screen space, but since it
is an almost exact replica of the Minimoog, you'll appreciate the size once you start twisting knobs and editing
sounds. The original Minimoog was a monophonic synth with three oscillators. This version also
has three oscillators but is polyphonic! You can choose from 1 through 8 and 16 or 32 voices of
polyphony for each sound patch. That alone takes the famous Minimoog sound into territories
the original never could go! And speaking of sound patches, the original had no memory, but
there's virtually unlimited patch memory here, and the Minimoog V ships with over 400 programmed
patches, many by famous artists! Patches include: Basses, Arpeggios, EFX, Keyboards, Leads,
Pads, Percussion, Horns, Synths, and Template patches. The Templates are a great starting point
for creating your own Leads, Pads, Basses, etc.The front panel controls replicate the look and layout (and underlying synth architecture) of
the original. There are three oscillators, each with selectable Triangular, Sawtooth, Square,
Saw/Triangular, Wide Rectangular and Narrow Rectangular waveforms. Oscillator 1
has an Osc Sync switch, while Oscillators 2 and 3 have fine tune knobs. The Mixer
section has On/Off switches and Level knobs for each of the three oscillators
as well as the Noise Generator (white or pink) and External Stereo Audio Input. Next stop for after the Mixer section is the famous Moog 24dB/oct lowpass filter, replicated here
by Arturia to perfection! The same 6 knobs as the original: Cutoff, Emphasis (resonance),
Amount, Attack time, Decay time, and Sustain time. The VCA section has the same
Attack, Decay, Sustain control knobs as the original too. And like the original, that's
about it for front-panel controls and functions, aside from a few other tuning and
volume controls, including the built-in A-440 tone generator for 'tuning up' the Mini.But the Minimoog V goes well beyond the capabilities of the original with more than just stereo
and polyphonic capabilities and program memory. One of the cool features of the original Mini
was that the front panel could be lifted up to be more perpendicular to the keyboard for
easier use while playing and editing. Clicking on the Minimoog V's panel will cause
it to lift up a bit too, revealing a whole new world of features the Minimoog never had, but should have:
an LFO, Arpeggiator, Chorus and Delay effects, and a Modulation Matrix! The LFO offers
sine, saw up, saw down, square, noise, random, sample-and-hold modes with rate control
and MIDI sync switch. The Arpeggiator has Up, Down, Random, Backwards, and Notes Played patterns
adjustable over 1 to 5 octaves and 1 to 5 repeats as well as Chord Memory, adjustable Speed
and MIDI sync. The Chorus offers three types with Rate, Depth and Wet/Dry controls. The Delay
has independent left/right controls for both Decay Time and Feedback Amounts with MIDI sync for
surprisingly animated delay effects within the stereo field. The Modulation Matrix is simple and powerful:
it lets you assign 6 sources to 6 destinations, ie: assign the LFO to the VCF cutoff, or assign
the Pitch Wheel to control the pitch of just Oscillator 1.Finally, although most users will play the Minimoog V using a MIDI keyboard/controller, the
virtual built-in keyboard replicates the original's 44-note keyboard with Pitch Wheel, Mod wheel,
Glide, Legato, and Pitch Bend range controls. It adds stereo Send outputs too.At just $249, the cost of the Minimoog V is much cheaper than an original almost 30 year
old Minimoog as well as the newer Minimoog Voyager. On top of that, the features offered
in the Minimoog V don't just replicate the original, but go way beyond it! It's hard to imagine how
we used the old Minimoog when you see, and hear what Arturia has done with it!",

to experience the classic Modular Synthesizer. In short,
modular synthesis was the birth of analog (and eventually digital)
synthesis in which various task specific ""modules"" were linked
together to create musical sounds. One module may consist
of an oscillator, another may be the filter, an effect, an LFO,
etc. Users would patch cables between them to route a signal
from module to module in an effort to create musical sounds. One of the absolute fathers of modular synthesizers was
Moog's behemoth Modular series, and now Arturia has created a virtual synth based on the classic
Moog series. The look, sound, feel, and experience have been
emulated and improved upon here in Arturia's Moog Modular V,
which is available for all popular soft-synth formats for Mac
and PC (VST, DXi, Audio Units, MAS, RTAS, HTDM, and more).Arturia uses ""TAE"" - True Analog Emulation to create a nice and warm and very close re-creation
of the original Moog sound. It virtually eliminates any 'aliasing' caused
by digital oscillators and even creates some of the instabilities
associated with a genuine 'analog' sound. The MMV was developed with help from Bob Moog
himself to insure an accurate recreation.An original Moog Modular, though antique and hard to maintain and afford these
days, was ultimately more customizable than this new soft-synth. Users could pick
and choose which modules they wanted to install in their Moog's wooden cabinets, but Arturia's MMV
comes with a pre-determined set of modules which can't be swapped out
or changed, unfortunately. 
In fact, the MMV itself does not represent any particular
modular system originally released by Moog either (such as the Moog 3P or 55), and rather comes with a collection of all-around
useful modules selected from among Moog's history of modular synthesizers. These modules include: 9 oscillators, 3 filter slots, 2 LFOs, 
6 envelopes, VCAs, mixers, triggers, a 3x8 step-sequencer, etc. Patching
is very much like the original method, but is color-coded for easier visual
navigation. When you start drawing a patch, it's possible destinations
are indicated on-screen too, and the cables will wobble, bounce and move out of
the way of the mouse as you navigate. Unlike the original, you can also
connect any output to multiple inputs for greater flexibility. The nine oscillator modules are modeled after the Moog 921a and 921b oscillators
which offer simultaneously available sine, triangle, sawtooth, and pulse waveforms.
White and Pink noise is also available, based on the Moog 923 module. The three independent filter modules offer lowpass, highpass,
filter coupler (band pass), and a new resonant multi-mode configuration. They sound
great, although not quite the same as the original Moog, especially at high resonant frequencies.
Additionally there's a filter bank modeled after the Moog 914 Filter bank,
with 9 adjustable frequency bands (sort of a graphic/parametric EQ). There are 6 Aux ADSR 
envelope generators modeled after the Moog 911 envelopes as well as
two main ADSR envelopes for the output amplifiers.It is within this first window (pictured at top) that you can see, edit and patch all the modules
responsible for creating and shaping your sounds. The second window (above) shows
the step sequencer, effects sections, virtual keyboard, and any quick access global
controllers. The sequencer is modeled after the Moog 960 sequencer module,
with three rows of 8 steps (24 steps total); it's like three independent 8-step
sequencers. Each row has it's own outputs and trigger inputs. The sequencer can be
used to control the oscillators, envelopes, filters, etc. for very creative
and animated sounds. Above the virtual keyboard are some
very cool controllers such as two X-Y Sound Controller joysticks, 3 Filter Cutoff
knobs and two ADSR controls for the two main VCA's, and a flexible Keyboard
Controller section to adjust pitch bend and modulation ranges and keyboard followers.
These allow you to split or layer the keyboard zones, adjust and transpose tunings,
and utilize portamento and legato effects. The effects offered are new (never available on the original Moog) and include
a flexible Dual Delay and Stereo Chorus. Additional modern day features include MIDI implementation, non-drifting oscillators and plenty of patch memory
storage. In fact, the MMV ships with over 400 patches created by experienced
sound designers and also has several template patches to get you started making your
own patches! Although not a totally accurate re-creation of a particular Moog Modular, Arturia's
MMV does emulate the look, feel, sound - the experience - of using a Moog Modular
with modern day features quite well. And don't forget, it is endorsed by Bob Moog himself!
It's the perfect tool for anyone interested in these classic 
machines or anyone wanting to learn about how synthesizers and all their individual
components work together to create sounds.",

with respect to the classic Prophet synth emulators. The Prophet-V offers
two of Sequential Circuits most groundbreaking instruments in one
complete package: The analog king Prophet 5 and the vector based
ProphetVS synthesizers. What's even more delicious about the Prophet-V,
is that these two divergent synthesis systems can be combined into a
Hybrid mode allowing for Prophet-like sounds never before possible with
previous software emulations or even the original vintage machines - at
least not at this affordable price or in such a convenient and intuitive
package! Available as a stand-alone and plug-in soft synth for Mac and
PC, the Prophet-V supports VST, DXi, Audio Units, RTAS, ASIO and
Core Audio.First we'll examine the Prophet 5 emulation. Arturia uses their TAE
(True Analog Emulation) synthesis to offer a true replica of the classic
Prophet 5 - one of the first polyphonic programmable synthesizers of its
time. The sounds are classic seventies analog: warm, gritty and unique.
The interface looks nearly identical to the original, and offers the
same basic subtractive synthesis that should be familiar and intuitive
enough to any musician who's been around an analog synth. Like the P5,
it has two oscillators (A: saw & square; B: saw, triangle, square) with
pulse-width and noise and individual mixer controls. A 24dB/oct
(self-oscillating) filter with cutoff, resonance, env amt, kybd
tracking, and ADSR controls. An amplifier with ADSR. An LFO section with
saw, tri and square wave shapes and a rate control. Sequential's
Poly-Mod section, Wheel-Mod section, Legato - all 54 parameters of the
original Prophet are here. Arturia tried so hard to remain true to the original
that the Prophet-V ships with the original factory Prophet 5 patches -
all 40 of them - loaded into its memory. Arturia's new features include
just a monophonic Unison mode, a Sustain feature, plus Chorus and Delay
effects (and of course, unlimited patch memory along with a bunch of
additional patches programmed by renowned sound designers).Sonically, the Prophet 5 emulation is spot on! The original P5 has a
very unique sound, due to the age of its components and the nature of
its chips that were available during its production. They sound warm but
also, sometimes, a little thin or lacking in the meat department. But
because of a P5's age, they are prone to having dirty or distorted
artifacts, noisy pots, flaky buttons that may or may not work, dead keys
on the keyboard, and a tendency to drift out of tune the more it warms
up. All these may add up to ""character,"" but in a real world scenario,
they can be a burden. This is where the Prophet-V comes in, with a sound
quality that is unmistakably Prophet, but without the ""age"" in its
sound or interface. This is one Prophet that will remain in tune and will never let
you down in the studio or on stage (unless of course your computer
crashes). Due to the outrageous prices and rarity of vintage P5s, the
Prophet-V is an excellent way to add the sounds and the feel of using
and programming one to your synth studio - the Prophet 5 emulation alone
is worth it, rivaling and in some ways out-doing competing soft synth
replicas of the P5!ProphetVS ModeNext up is the ProphetVS emulation, one of the few places where you can
find this form of synthesis in a software synth. Briefly, the ProphetVS
was a ground breaking synth for Sequential that uses digitally stored
waveforms in a table, which are freely selected and blended together
(usually with a joystick) by the user. This synth came out right at
the same time that Sequential went out of business, so the original
machines are quite rare and sought after. Their technology, however,
went directly into the Korg Wavestation series and also the Waldorf
Microwave series.So, back to the Prophet-V. Actually, the ProphetVS is not visually
replicated here, in fact the Prophet-V looks almost nothing like the
original. But that's a good thing, the original had a very primitive and
counterintuitive interface, which has been remedied here, some 20
years later by Arturia. There are the same 96 digitally sampled waveforms of the original ProphetVS here,
and you can choose up to four of them for your sound. You can see a
graphic representation of each waveform as you browse through them while
assigning them to each of the four oscillators. Frequency and tuning
for each osc can be adjusted. Then there is the Vector-based joystick,
which is basically the mixer that lets you adjust how much of each
waveform will be heard - the interactions of the various waveforms you
choose will yield interesting but almost entirely unpredictable results
- experimentation is the name of the game! There are few other basic
synth functions including a filter which can be set to Low Pass, High Pass,
Band Pass, or Band Reject modes, with cutoff, resonance and env amount
controls. The filter has a 5-point envelope that can be drawn for unique
shapes. The amp section offers volume and stereo pan controls
for all voices or each of the five separate voices independently (this
can allow for some awesome stereo sounds). The Amp also has a 5-point
envelope that can be drawn, just like the filter. All envelopes are
shown as graphic representations of their shape. There's also two simple
LFOs with tri, saw, square, ramp and random waveforms and a rate
control. The complex modulation capabilities of the original ProphetVS are
greatly simplified in Arturia's graphically displayed Modulation matrix
section, where you can intuitively assign a Mod source (LFOs, pressure,
velocity, envelopes, mod wheel) to a destination (osc frequencies, osc
mix amounts, filter cutoff, env, LFO rates, volumes, panning, etc.).
This allows you to create far more dynamic sounds that can move around in
stereo, evolve over time, undulate, vibrate and morph - all in a manner
much more easy to understand and execute than on the original machine.
In addition, Arturia has added some new features to the ProphetVS such
as chorus and delay effects, and unison and legato modes. Oh, and in
case you have not already figured it out, the Prophet-V sounds as close
to the original instrument as any modern day computer based software
instrument can, thanks to Arturia's excellent TAE synthesis.Prophet-V Hybrid ModeFor the low, low price of this software package, this is an unbeatable
way to acquire pretty much everything the classic Sequential line of
synths had to offer. And even though each of these two emulations are
amazing on their own, let's not forget that Arturia has allowed us a
Hybrid mode where you can join the Prophet 5 and the ProphetVS together
into a monster synth! This is where sounds that you never thought
possible from a Sequential start to emerge. While the two synths are
still independent of each other, they are joined via the Modulation
matrix and an audio mixer. So in the Mod matrix you can actually
modulate P5 parameters through some of the PVS' mod sources, and
likewise some of the PVS' parameters can be modulated by some of the
P5's mod sources. The stacked hybrid also shares the same chorus and
delay effects as well.Out of the box, the Prophet-V comes with original factory patches for
the P5 and the PVS. There are additional programmed sounds for each
instrument and there are a bunch of programmed sounds for the Hybrid
mode, for over 500 programs out of the box! Import of MIDI sysex from
original P5 and PVS synths is also supported so you can load in your own
custom patches from the real synths or from the plethora of patch files
available from libraries and the internet. Patches are organized by
synth type and sound type and there are convenient blank template
patches to get you started programming your own personal sounds. The
Prophet-V supports up to 96kHz for superior digital sound quality, and
with no aliasing from 0.1 Hz up to 16kHz. Polyphony is also up from the
originals (the P5 had 5 voices, the PVS had 8 voices) supporting from 2
up to 32 voices. For its price, the audio quality, intuitive interface,
emulative accuracy, and expanded abilities and possibilities, the
Arturia Prophet-V is an amazing instrument that belongs in every
musician's computer, and is definitely worth checking out before choosing
to throw down two times or more money on an unreliable original vintage
version - unless of course ""character"" is all you're after.",125

digital music production studio. It's a 16-bit sampler that came in both
keyboard and rack-mount versions. It shipped with 2 MB of sample memory which could be expanded
to 16 MB for a few minutes of stereo cd-quality sampling time. 
It lets you choose from sample rates of 30 to 44.1 kHz and has all
the professional sample editing functions you would expect to find from a 
pro sampler including autolooping, volume smoothing, normalize, crossfading, and time comp/exp. 
Even resampling through its effects, EQ, etc. is possible!What's special about the ASR-10 is that it is a sampler using the synthesizer
architecture of Ensoniq's classic line of synths from the SD-1 to the ESQ-1.
Your samples are stored as part of its WaveSample memory. The ASR-10 can hold 127 WaveSamples,
which can also consist of its two multimode digital filters, the LFO,
one random noise generator, three envelope generators (hard-wired to the pitch, filter cutoff, and amplitude),
and a modulation matrix with 15 routable modulation sources. Up to eight
layers of WaveSamples can be combined to create your final sound.
In this light, the ASR-10 basically looks like an advanced TranseWave (waveform modulation)
synthesizer in which YOU create its WaveSamples!The ASR-10 integrates a digital effects processor and MIDI sequencer
on-board for a complete workstation. There are up to 62 effects
(including vocoding) based on Ensoniq's DP/4 effects processor. A whole
range of reverbs, chorus, flange, phaser, distortion, digital delay,
speaker effects, etc. are available.The ASR-10's sequencer has 16-tracks and with its 31 voices of polyphony
you can create some pretty complete musical performances. The sequencer
(reminiscent of the SD-1 and VFX-SD workstations) provides real time and looped
recording modes, 96 PPQ clock resolution, an auto-locate function, punch
in/out, and other useful features. And the ASR-10 can sample while the
sequencer is playing. It can store up to 80 sequences or patterns which
can be chained into a song (only one song can be in memory).The ASR-10 also has a ""Tape Recorder"" mode in which you can record two
tracks of audio for use along with the sequencer for an advanced
all-in-one music making machine! Recording can be to its RAM or to
external SCSI hard drives via the SP-3 SCSI interface (optional on
keyboard version) for extended sampling/recording time and memory. It
can support up to seven simultaneous hard disks and/or CD-ROM drives.
You can even process external audio through the ASR, live or along with
sequences.As mentioned, the ASR-10 comes in a 61-note keyboard version and a rack-mount.
But there's more. Over the years Ensoniq has continued to upgrade it adding an
AES/EBU digital I/O upgrade, digital audio recording and importing of new sound formats, and more.
The ASR-88 version is an ASR-10 with a fully-weighted 88-note keyboard and the SCSI interface comes standard.
The ASR-10 is compatible with Akai (S-1000/1100) and Roland CD-ROM sound librarys.
A high-density (HD) 3.5"" disk drive comes standard on all models.
The ASR-10 has been used by Atomic Babies, Autechre, Rammstein, Jimmy Edgar, Black Lung, Rabbit in the Moon,
Timbaland, Pharell Williams (Neptunes), The Alchemist, Kanye West.",

get the sort of sounds the ASR-X is intended for: drum and perc sounds, vocal stabs, and other quick short
sounds. The built-in synthesizer is based on Ensoniq's unique Transwave technology for really
unique synth sounds and life-like real instruments. A powerful effects processor gives you all you
need to bring life and character to your samples and synth sounds.Of course the sequencer is the heart of this instrument. Though it can be used like a sound module 
or desktop sampler, those big “house” shaped pressure pads are not there just for decoration.
This instrument begs to have it sounds tapped into sequences in real-time (or step-time)
so you can bring your patterns to life in seconds. If necessary the sequencer does allows
you to delve in deeper for fine tuning - although it was a buggy headache on early models,
that could be rectified via OS upgrades.Although it has since been replaced by the ASR-X Pro, the original ASR-X is still
pretty great. For the most part, they're both the same, except that the ASR-X is not as expandable. 
However it still has easy programming, excellent analog-like filters (low, high and 
bandpass), a great sampler, digital effects and easy sequencing. Like the MPC-series,
the ASR-series has been a mainstay production tool for HipHop and Rap music.",

opponent. It's got professional sampler specifications, and easy yet
professional sample editing features. Process your samples with modern
edit functions including copying, truncating, reduce bits, scaling,
normalizing and inverting. It has enough built-in effects to sweeten
your samples with: EQ, Reverb, Chorus, Flanger, DDL, Distortion, Tunable
Speaker, Chatter Box, Vocal Morph, and Auto-Wah. Sequencing is also easy
and hands-on. Microscopic Tempo control and resolution allow for punchy
groovy sequences with plenty of feel and note capacity. There are also
independent dual multi-mode dynamic digital filters with low-pass,
high-pass, variable bandwidth band-pass, resonant low-pass and resonant
band-pass.What separates the ASR-X Pro from the ASR-X? The Pro now offers
a SCSI interface for limitless storage to disk or drive. A cool new
Flash OS system means you can upgrade it simply by inserting a floppy,
no messing with ROM chips! There's a new Stomper program that synthesizes
phatt analog drum machine sounds (a built-in drum machine) - giving the MPC3000 a run for its groove.
Memory can be expanded to a whopping 66MB for over 12 minutes (mono) sampling time.
There is also a very cool Resampling technology that allows you to digitally resample
sounds, loops or sequences with any effects and tweaks you've applied back into itself.
Optional upgrades beside memory include the ESP-2 effects chip, EXP 24MB sound and 
wave expansion board and the X-8 eight output expander. The ASR-X Pro is compatible with

The EPS is just that with
clever new features that make it not just a professional studio music
production tool, but also a powerful live performance instrument. Its
biggest feature is its ability to load new samples while playing the
instrument, a feature you'd be lucky to find on current synth/samplers.
The EPS is somewhat multitimbral in that you can have 8 instruments
on-line one at a time or stacked* and switching between them is as easy
as pushing one of the 8 instrument buttons. The 'Patch Select' buttons
over the Mod-Wheel allow for on-the-fly patch switching from a spot
where your hand is likely to be while performing!Its unique 13-bit sampler is highly versatile with multiple sample rates to choose
from (6.25 to 52kHz). However, higher sample rates mean less polyphony
and sample time. Unfortunately sample memory is miniscule at 480 Kb
yielding anywhere from 5 to 41 seconds of sample time. Fortunately it is
expandable up to 896 Kb (with optional 2x expander) or 2.1 Mb (with
optional 4x or 4x+SCSI expanders) allowing as much 167 seconds
of sample time. Some of the EPS's goodies include an 8 to 16 track
sequencer (which steals its memory space from the same RAM that holds
the samples) with quantizing, digital filters that seem like analog and
preset template envelope options.The EPS brought together many facets of synthesis at its time: sampling,
synthesis and performance. It blended these together in a superb machine
that, despite its limited sample memory, is quite popular and useful
even today. Though it was later upgraded to the full 16-bit EPS-16+, the 13-bit EPS is a very
cost-efficient alternative for any musician in search of classic
keyboard-samplers!* Although you usually play one instrument part at a time, you can get
all 8 up at a time. With the EPS in Load mode by first selecting an
instrument and then double clicking another instrument both will be
played together. Continue double-clicking the other instrument buttons
to layer all 8 instruments! (submitted by Rod Wesson and John Rule).The EPS has been used by Cirrus, Wu-tang producer RZA and filmaker/composer John Carpenter.",

90's. Its sampler specs are impressive: 16-bit, variable sampling rates
from 11.2kHz to 44.6kHz. With a slim 1Mb of memory this gives just about
11.5 seconds of sampling time in mono at 44.6kHz. Editing functions are
quite nice: normalizing, sample splicing, merging, phase switching,
auto-looping, auto-truncating, sample rate conversion and more.On the synthesizer side it has two great filters with switchable hi, low
and band pass, 6dB to 24dB cutoffs. BUT, they aren't resonant. The
keyboard is velocity and pressure sensitive and it has full MIDI
implementation. There is also a sophisticated 8-track sequencer that can
really be fun in a live performance situation. A wildly flexible and
variable LFO with seven shapes always adds a new twist to your samples!
Topping it off is a full suite of on-board effects like reverb, delay,
chorus, flange, phaser, Leslie sim, distortion and wah-wah and these
effects can be re-sampled to become a part of the sample! It can even be
played while it is loading samples!In its time, the EPS-16+ was a revolutionary machine. It brought a lot
of power and musicality to sampling. These days, the EPS-16+ is still
useful. It brings back the early crunchy sampler sound but with a
lot of features that make it really fun to play with. Even with its
non-resonant filters you can still find yourself filtering a
'garage-beat' drum loop for hours while muting and un-muting other loops
on the 8-track sequencer!The EPS-16+ was also made available in a
rack-mount version. All EPS-16+ synths can be upgraded via non-volatile
flash ROM (available on-line from Chicken Systems,

potential! It has been used by Autechre, LFO, Massive Attack and

Although the waveforms are digital in nature, the filters are all analog as on the Mirage. In fact, for a digital synth the ESQ-1 has many good old analog-synth features such as a ring modulator, sequencer, and oscillator-sync. The envelopes and LFOs are can be freely routed to each DCO, VCA and or VCF. There are 40 preset sounds which are the usual not-so-great sounds. Luckily the VFD display screen is large enough to make editing the sounds somewhat pleasant. What really sets the ESQ-1 apart from other similar synths is the voice architecture. Choose from analog, digital, or samples or any combo since there are three independent oscillators per voice! Once you start editing on the ESQ-1 you will come up with interesting and unique results. Using dynamic voice allocation it can seemlesly switch from 8-voices of analog to 8-voices of digital or sampled voices! This gives you a wide array of different sonic elements at your fingertips!Then there's its built-in sequencer. It can store up to 24,000 notes in 30 sequences and 10 songs via battery back-up. Anyone in search of an alternative synthesizer should consider the ESQ-1. More analog than a DX-7 or D-50 and also much cheaper, the ESQ-1 is a tasty option that is worth a try. The ESQ-M (pictured above) is a rack-mount version released in 1987 which is identical to the ESQ-1 except that it excludes the on-board sequencer option. The ESQ-synths have been used by Anything Box, Skinny Puppy, Jean-Michel Jarre, and Steve Roach. ",

technology to create very organic sounds unlike any other synth available.  Every
programming function has its own dedicated knob or button, and there is a limited
but useful 4-character LCD display.  The Fizmo features an Arpeggiator and 24-bit VLSI effects
with 41 algorithms, including a Vocoder and the ability to process
incoming audio through the Vocoder and effects.  Transwave synthesis uses wavetables of sound data with layered variations
in harmonic structures such that their timbres progress naturally from one end to the other.
This allows for sounds to modulate over time, or by velocity, wheel, pressure, or 
any number of other options.There are 2 oscillators available for each of the 4 presets allowing for 8 unique 
oscillators at the same time, not to mention individual LFO and Noise generators 
for each Osc. Another wonderful feature is the ability to stack up to four
individual presets together into one sound and map them across the keyboard.  
This synth is very capable of some very complex sounds.The built-in Arpeggiator has 118 presets which
can be easily edited to your liking, and 26 real-time control/editing knobs make
mutating your sound a pleasure. All controls may be recorded in real-time
to an external sequencer.The Fizmo Rack is 5U rack-mount version of the Fizmo with more patches.
The Fizmo will appeal to anyone who creates electronic music,
particularly those into techno, trance, ambient or industrial.  Sound designers
and film composers would also enjoy this synth. The evolving motion and rhythmic
patterns of its sounds created by the Transwave technology set this synth
apart from the others. The Fizmo has been used by Eat Static.",

and EPS-16+ sampler workstations in the
Ensoniq line-up; in fact, the Mirage was Ensoniq's first commercial
product. Historically, the Mirage was also one of the earliest
affordable sampler/sequencer workstations, originally listing under
$1,700. Compared with the much more expensive Fairlight CMI and Synclavier samplers of the time, the
Mirage was a bargain!The Mirage was an 8-bit sampler capable of a maximum sampling-rate of
32kHz with a limited 128Kb of RAM. Those are pretty old-school specs by
today's standards and while it does mean your sounds will be somewhat
lo-fi, that does not mean low quality. A built-in 3.5 inch DD disk drive
was used to load and store samples, sequences - even the operating
system. Each disk could hold up to 6 samples and 8 sequences. The
keyboard is split in to two independent halves for an upper sound and a
lower sound - great for playing two instruments at a time. Unfortunately, sample
editing is done via hexadecimal-code manipulation which is not a simple to concept to master.
Most users will just load-in sounds from the Mirage's extensive sample
library, or look for computer programs that can edit or convert Mirage samples.While the Mirage's limited sampling specs, limited polyphony (8
voices) and limited sequencer (333 notes) may seem to knock it off
anyone's list when looking for a keyboard sampler, the Mirage
still has a few hidden goodies under its hood. Most notably, it has
analog filters...a true, analog VCF with low-pass filtering and keyboard
tracking. In addition to that it has five-stage envelopes for the VCA
and VCF and a nice LFO. Most models also featured a weighted, velocity
sensitive keyboard.Mirage DSK-1Speaking of models, there have been several versions of the Mirage during its lifetime.
The DSK-8 was the original model and it featured a black steel chassis
and a weighted Pratt-Reed keyboard. Later DSK-8 models were updated with
a dark gray chassis and an improved Fatar keyboard as the original Pratt-Reed
did not have very good feel. These later DSK-8 models are identified by smaller gray+yellow 
buttons and a solid yellow Mirage logo. In 1985 the DMS-8 rack-mount version of the DSK-8 was
released. Then, in 1986 the DSK-1 appeared
with a newer lighter plastic chassis, a relocated disk drive, an un-weighted keyboard
action and the addition of stereo outputs. The DSK-1 is easily identified by the solid red stripe on the front panel.Mirage DMS-8Most people searching for a classic Ensoniq sampler/synth would probably first look towards
the EPS and EPS-16+. After all, their specs,
design and quality are superior. However, there is a certain amount of
nostalgia concerned with the Mirage, particularly with its sample library which still stands the test of time. It has been used by Skinny
Puppy, Vangelis, Jimmy Edgar, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.",

synthesizers. It began with Ensoniq's earliest synthesizer, the ESQ-1. That led to
the SQ-80, then the VFX and VFX-SD (the latter featuring an on-board sequencer) and then to the
SD-1 (and it eventually led to the Fizmo). The SD-1 allows for additive synthesis
using waveform modulation, a sort of wavetable synthesis. This puts it
into a unique class of digital synthesizers along with the PPG Wave series and Waldorf Microwave series.The SD-1 can create all sorts of acoustic, electric, digital, and
analog-like sounds. Its piano sound has over 1 MB of 16-bit waveforms to
give it a full and rich realistic tone not found in other digital
synthesizers of the time. That piano sound was just the beginning of
what would become the ""Perfect Piano"" used in Ensoniq's ZR-76 and E-mu/Ensoniq's Halo series ""Sounds of the ZR""
ROM expansion soundset.The SD-1 has 21 voices of polyphony just like its predecessor, the VFX (a 32 voice version later became available).
A single patch can contain up to 6 of the 168 waves in its ROM memory
that can be combined and layered. Advanced and analog-like synth
parameters including its dual multi-mode digital filters, three 11-stage
envelopes, LFO, and 15 modulation sources allow you to further shape and
morph your sounds. There's even a built-in 24-bit VLSI dual effects
processor with reverb, chorus, flanging and delay. The SD-1 also has a
standard 61-note keyboard with velocity sensitivity, polyphonic aftertouch and
full MIDI implementation with 12 channels for multitimbral functions as well as
four 16-bit DAC outputs.Like the VFX-SD, the SD-1 has a professional quality on-board sequencer
making it a complete all-in-one music production workstation. This is a
24-track sequencer with 25,000 note capacity and
it holds up to 60 sequences and 20 songs. There is quantization (96 ppqn),
real-time or step entry, looped or linear mode, and auto-punch in/out.
Tracks can be set to control the SD-1's internal voices or external MIDI
equipment, or both at the same time! An on-board 3.5"" disk drive allows
you to store your programs, sequences, songs, and even MIDI SysEx data.
The SD-1 is compatible with all VFX and VFX-SD program librarys too. An optional
SQX-70 Sequencer Expander upgrades the sequencer memory from 25,000 to
over 75,000 notes.",

with a total of 75 waveforms, a 61-note keyboard with velocity &
aftertouch, floppy disk drive for storing patches and sequences, and an
enhanced sequencer. Great for organs, analog-type sounds, pads and sound
effects. Like the classic ESQ-1, the SQ-80 functions in providing
analog-type 4-pole lowpass filtering and editing of digital waveforms.
Each voice can combine up to 3 of the 75 waveforms. These waveforms
include multi-sampled transient attack waves such as violin bow,
plectrum picks, mallet, hammer, breath attacks and percussive sounds.
There are also 5 sampled drum sets. Three LFOs are onboard for some
pretty wild modulation of the sounds you create or edit. Complete MIDI
implementation makes the SQ-80 great for any studio or live use too.As for playing the SQ-80, it is a dream! Its 61-note keyboard is full,
responsive and has polyphonic aftertouch. Polyphonic aftertouch simply
means that each key pressed will respond to aftertouch independently of
the other keys. The aftertouch can be used to control a variety of
modulation parameters such as the LFO. Pitch and mod wheels and plenty
of front-panel buttons and a few sliders make accessing and editing
fairly easy and hands-on. The keyboard can be split or layered. The
pattern-based 8-track multitimbral sequencer is great for creating short
to complex sequences live, or in step time with quantization,
bounce-able tracks, 60 sequence patterns and 20 songs. And they can be
saved to disk along with any patches you've created and any SysEx Midi
data. Unfortunately, the SQ-80 has no built-in effects. The SQ-80 is
certainly a classic analog/digital hybrid of the late eighties which
still holds up well today. It has been used by filmaker/composer John

the line that started with the ESQ-1
and progressed through the SQ-80, VFX, VFX-SD,
SD-1, and SD-1/32. The resulting TS contained the most
advanced feature set, most powerful sequencer and sound engine, and
provided high quality sound and powerful effects processing.The TS series consists of two models: The TS-10 with a 61-note synth
action keyboard with velocity and polyphonic aftertouch, and the TS-12
which is virtually the same instrument, but it has 76-note hammer action
keyboard with a channel aftertouch feature from Fatar. No rack-module
version was produced.The synthesizer section has 32 voices of polyphony (12 MIDI tracks of
multitimbrality). It uses a ROM bank with 6 MB of samples from various
acoustic instruments, synth waves, percussion and sound effects. A
single patch is called a ""Sound"" and can be made from combining up to
six waves. Each ""Sound"" can have up to four variations which are
selected via two ""Patch Selector Buttons"" above the Pitch-bend and
Modulation wheels. A performance patch, called a ""Preset"" can be made
from up to three ""Sounds"" with independent settings for each ""Sound"".
Arranged by banks are 120 user ""Sounds"" and 120 user ""Preset""
performance patches plus 180 preset ""Sounds"" and 180 preset ""Preset""
performance patches. There is also one bank for 10 sampled sounds which
can be doubled if the RAM is expanded. The General MIDI sound set is
also available in the TS.The TS-10/12 makes use of the following four types of synthesis
technologies:Wavetable synthesis with the following parameters for each
tone: Three envelopes, two multistage filters (unfortunately without
resonance), an LFO with settings for tone pitch, output, panning, delay,
multisample shift + modulation matrix, and more.Transwave: Similar to Wavetable synthesis, this technology
allows real time changes to the tonal timbrality. The Transwave consists
of 128 single cycle waves, each of which is part of the original (highly
processed) sample. The loop start and end points can be modulated in
real time by various sources like the LFO, envelope generators,
modulation wheel, etc. The TS series synthesizers ROM includes eight
types of Transwaves (far fewer than the SD-1 had, unfortunately) and new
ones can be created as a sample and imported into RAM.Hyperwave technology is a kind of wave sequencing similar to
that used by the Korg Wavestation.
The wave list can contain up to 16 steps and allows you to create
impressive textures or rhythmic patterns.Sampling: The TS series instruments can load samples from
compatible Ensoniq samplers (EPS, EPS 16+ and ASR-10/88) into its RAM via 3.5"" floppy
disks or the optional SP-4 SCSI interface. Many sampled sounds will not
fit into the standard 2 MB memory and therefore the memory expansion
option up to 8 MB is recommended. Sample editing is very similar to the
EPS/ASR systems. The only problem is that the TS can not save the sample
data directly on EPS/ASR disks. You must use another disk (formatted
using the unique TS format) to save your sample data, and to load an
edited sound you must use both these disks because the TS saves only the
edit settings without the actual samples. The RAM is volatile and the
sampled sounds efface each time you turn the instrument off.The effects section is based on Ensoniq's famous DP-4 effects
processor. It includes 73 preset algorithms with up to 10 variations of
each algorithm. There are 692 variations of effects including various
Reverbs, Delays, Choruses, Flangers, Phasers, Distortions, Speaker
cabinet simulations, Rotary speakers, and a lot more. Each algorithm can
consist of up to three simultaneous effects. The effects section is
fully programmable and can be modulated by various sources. The user's
setting is stored together with the appropriate ""Sound"" or ""Preset"".The 24-Track sequencer has a typical Ensoniq structure: There are 12
non-linear Tracks for composing short blocks (called ""Sequences"") and
another 12 linear tracks. It features many functions like quantization,
mixing, event editing, controller filtering, etc. Its capacity is 30,000
notes and that can be expanded up to 97,000 notes.The TS-10 Plus (a later model) used a conventional LCD screen and was
equipped with the SCSI interface and fully loaded RAM options as
standard. The weak point in the TS series workstations is that they are
totally incompatible with anything other than the aforementioned Ensoniq
samplers. They can not load nor save .mid files, .wav sounds, etc. and
they can not use standard DOS formatted disks.Despite the non-resonant filters, the TS series workstations are very
powerful synths with a rich and thick sound. They can produce complete
musical arrangements in a number of genres. The succeeding generations
of Ensoniq workstations (KT series and MR/ZR series) lost a lot of the TS's features
and many users consider the TS to be the best of Ensoniq's
workstations.",

and it holds up to 60 sequences and songs. There is quantization (96 ppqn),
real or step time input and auto-punch in/out. One thing that's kind of quirky, the
sequencer's operating system gets loaded into the instrument's RAM memory
from floppy disk (they replaced the bulky and proprietary cartridges of the VFX with a standard 3.5"" floppy drive). 
This allowed Ensoniq to provide new operating systems that you could 
load in real easily. This was a good thing since the VFX was plagued by bugs
during its early years and there were several subsequent OS versions released
by Ensoniq, the most recent of which can still be downloaded.The VFX-SD also adds new drum and percussion sounds including 24 drum kits.
A disk originally shipped with the VFX-SD full of pre-sequenced drum patterns
to get you going or inspired! Despite these newer features, the VFX-SD is totally
compatible with the original VFX sound library. The VFX-SD also featured four individual outputs,
MIDI Automated mixing, and an on-board 3.5"" disk drive for storing your sound patches,

was released, so Ensoniq re-released it with a few enhancements and called it the SD-1.",

Remaining faithful to the original design, circuitry and components, Studio Electronics has recreated the original in a new rackmount MIDI equipped unit. Every unit has a genuine Minimoog Model D board inside. They've added a new dedicated LFO in addition to the Midi. Unfortunately, due to the 100% analog design of this synth, including the analog pots and switch controllers, retrofitting patch memory to the original Minimoog boards would have been a major electronic undertaking. So just like the original Minis, there is no patch memory storage. The front panel layout of the Midimoog strongly resembles the Minimoog's original design. Familiar to old Minimoogers and fairly easy to learn and explore for the newer users. As for the sounds... they're the real thing. Three oscillators power this monophonic analog beast to create fat and warm synth basses, leads, blip-bleeps and sweeping sounds. The classic 24 dB/oct lowpass Moog filter is here too, and just as powerful as always. The rack-mountability and MIDI implementation alone make this an excellent choice for anyone looking for the famous warm Moog sounds in a compact yet classic MIDI-equipped module. It has been used by Fatboy Slim, Depeche Mode, Nitzer Ebb, Jean-Michel Jarre, and Glen Ballard (Alanis Morrisette's producer). They are rare, however, and sell for thousands of dollars typically. Since there wasn't an abundance of people who wanted their Minimoogs turned into a rack, Studio Electronics soon ran out of Model D boards. This led them to produce the MidiMini, which was a clone of the MidiMoog except that instead of using boards from Model D's, they simply built new boards from scratch based on the design and components of the Model D. So the MidiMini offers the same great sound as the MidiMoog and MiniMoog. ",

At the time, it was a state of the art computer based analog synthesizer commissioned by ex-Tangerine Dreamer Peter Baumann in 1979. It came at a time when E-mu, like other synth manufacturers of the time, were making a move towards producing an instrument that was more compact and more advanced than the purely analog modular beasts they had been making. Under pressure from synths like Sequential's Prophet-5, E-mu set out to make a very powerful analog synth. The Audity was a 16-voice instrument with a massive amount of programmability and stability thanks to the computer based technology that controlled it. Unfortunately the instrument was so expensive ($70,000) that nobody wanted to buy one. It was also a bear to program. E-mu wound up shelving it in order to start over with a new concept inspired by the Fairlight. This led to a sophisticated and much cheaper sampler - the Emulator 1. But the Audity had not been forgotten by E-mu. Much of the Audity's multi-timbral design went into the creation of the sample-playback Proteus synthesizers, which in turn paved way for the Audity 2000 sound module!The one and only living Audity is currently in a synthesizer gallery at the CANTOS Music Foundation in Calgary, Alberta Canada. It was never actually completed, so it has never actually worked. As such, it remains a truly one-of-a-kind show-piece of what could have been - the synthesizer equivalent of a concept-car.",

The Drumulator had eight drum sounds on a ROM microchip which were gritty, lo-fi 12-bit samples of basic drum sounds...but they were some classic sounds! The Drumulator II added sampling so you could bring in your own sounds. Samples could be truncated, looped, etc.  The Drumulator was primarily a drum machine, however, and offered sequencing that could be accomplished in real-time for a live feel. Or it could be meticulously programmed via step entry and edit modes. Up to 36 sequenced patterns can be stored, chained and mixed to create up to 8 songs. Your sequences and sample data can be stored to floppy diskettes. The Drumulator can be connected to an old computer (like an Apple II) for better visual sequencing and editing too.

editing is easy, complete and intuitive with auto sample placement,
auto-looping, truncating, reversing, velocity cross-fade, etc. The Emax
also features individual channel outputs and stereo outputs and
extensive MIDI implementation.The Emax features many common analog synth-type controls for easily
shaping your samples. Tune, filter and shape the envelope or use LFO's
and chorus to liven up your samples. There's also an on-board sequencer
section. A real-time only 16-track, non-quantizable sequencer for basic
scratch-pad use or simple arpeggios or patterns. The SE and SE Plus
models, the most advanced of the 12-bit Emax's, add a synthesizer
section, newer advanced digital signal processors for sample editing and
a SCSI port (standard on the SE Plus). The Emax instruments were the
most advanced of the classic keyboard samplers of the late 1980's.The Emax II which was released in 1989 brought the Emax series up to

affordable. The Emulator I debuted in 1981 with a price taag of $10,000!
Still pretty expensive, but E-mu reduced its price to $8,000 a year
later.The Emulator is very big, it's not very pretty and it uses big 5"" floppy
diskettes! Its look was designed by the same people that designed the
Apple II computer. The Emulator has eight voices of polyphony and some
may have MIDI retro-fitted as well although they never originally came
with MIDI. It had very primitive controls by today's standards. Only
real-time looping and trimming was possible, for example. And sample
memory is really slim with its tiny 128 KB good for about two seconds of
sampling time...and that's with its lo-fi 8-bit 27 kHz sampling specs.The Emulator was soon surpassed by the Emulator II which added far better controls,
a data display and memory space. The Emulator is most responsible for
E-mu's longevity and success, and the Emulator makes a great collector's
item even though it does not cut it as a usable machine these days. The

E-mu,Emulator IV,11891,http://www.vintagesynth.com/emu/emulator4,4.27,4,n/a,n/a,0,1,0,0,0,{},"The fourth and final generation of E-mu Systems' emulator hardware samplers were immensely powerful machines that were at the leading edge of music making technology for the eight years they were produced. The digital synthesis engine in these instruments was unfortunately overlooked by most musicians as it became caught up between the two prevailing trends of the new century - on one hand there were many excellent virtual analog synths offering immediate results and inherent simplicity, and on the other there was the advent of software instruments which used PC hardware that was becoming far more powerful and less expensive with every passing year.When compared with earlier samplers the Emulator IV offered more of everything, and only high-end models like the Akai S6000 or Kurzweil K2500 could be considered as direct competitors. When compared to the previous generation of samplers, the Emulator IV offered a larger display, more polyphony, better sound quality, more input/output options, better filters and effects processing, more memory capacity, and several other benefits that added up to one very large evolutionary step forward for the sampler category. Internal and external SCSI was standard on all models for storage expansion, and memory used standard computer SIMM's instead of the proprietary chips from the Emulator III series.The synthesis engine in the Emulator IV was based on the traditional model, with a 16-bit sample-based sound generator sending its output to a filter which then fed an amplifier stage. Every voice could be manipulated by two LFO's, three six-stage (AADDRR) Envelope Generators, and a 24-point modulation matrix. The high quality resonant filters were a highlight of this sampler, with the typical high pass, low pass, notch, and parametric filters complimented by a selection of Z-Plane morphing filters from E-mu's famous Morpheus and Ultra Proteus sound modules. All of this was complimented by a programmable arpeggiator, 48-track sequencer, and a full set of sample management and manipulation tools. The owner's manual for EOS 4.0 is over 400 pages long, which is just one indication of how deep the Emulator IV is.The sheer number of Emulator IV models can be overwhelming to the novice and expert alike. There were three series during the Emulator Four's lifetime, each series was launched with one high-end model and followed a few months later by a lower priced alternative that could be upgraded to the full specification using optional add-ons. There were a few exceptions to this rule, all noted below.The first series of Emulator IV samplers was introduced in 1994, and consisted of the rackmount EIV and E64. The EIV had 128 voice polyphony and a maximum 128 MB of memory, while the E64 had 64 voice polyphony and a maximum of 64 MB of memory. The second series was launched in early 1996 with the E4X Turbo and then followed up with the E6400. Also that year and in keeping with their long history of keyboard sampler-workstations, E-mu released the E4K keyboard which was effectively the 64-voice E6400 sound engine fitted into a 76-key chassis with output features targeted more towards the live player than the studio musician.In 1997, E-mu launched the E-Synth rackmount sampler &amp; E-Synth Keyboard. These added sound ROM's from the best selling E-mu sound module series and gave the Emulator IV series the ability to be played like a standard synthesizer within seconds of hitting the power switch, as these samples were instantly available in memory and did not require the user to manually load them as was the case in the other emulator modules. The ROM chip that contained these sounds was also available to other Emulator IV owners as an add-on option.The third and final series was released in 1999, and these models all had the Ultra designation. The most significant enhancement to this series was a 32-bit central processor, which allowed for faster performance in everyday operations and also enabling new DSP processing options including the Beat Munging sample slicing tool. The E4XT Ultra was the high-end model that led the lineup, and was followed by the E6400 Ultra. An E-Synth Ultra model was later added with the Sound ROM as standard, and then an E5000 Ultra which had the same internal engine but only had four analog outputs (instead of eight) lacked the ability to expand its polyphony beyond its standard 64 voices. There was no keyboard version in the Ultra series, all models were rack mounted.The very last hardware emulator released was the E4 Platinum which had every option installed at the factory, including the RFX32 effects processing card that was introduced as an option for the Ultra series samplers near the end of their production run.",

samplers and sample-playback ROM sound modules on the market. But they
got their start from humble beginnings in the very early 1970's. Based
out of California, USA, E-mu produced over 250 of these modular
synthesizers for famous artists and universities. These modular synths
were custom-built instruments and, although they competed against
classics like the ARP 2500, 2600 and Moog modular synthesizers, they were
initially intended for high-end users such as schools and at the request
of some famous musicians. The system requires patching via patch cords
to route your signal through its various modules to create musical
sounds. It also featured a firm-wire patch in which any front panel
patch could be made in the rear of the instrument. Inserting a front
panel patch would then bypass the firm-wired patch. So you can store a
favorite voicing or frequently used connections using the firm-wire
patches. The firm-wire patches are not permanent and can be easily
changed by the user.Modular systems meant that buyers could custom design their systems by
choosing specific modules that they wanted installed into their system.
E-mu modules available included: VCA, Quad Inverter, Low Pass Filter,
High Pass Filter, Ring Modulator, Dual Trans. Gen., Large VCO, Small
VCO, Noise gen., Sample-and-Hold, Envelope Follower, Dual Reverb, and
more. Each system was hand built to order and there are less than 100 or
so of these babies still around today! E-mu's oscillators were virtually
drift-free, unlike other major synthesizers of the time, because of
E-mu's unique circuit designs. Their filters were also cleaner than the
Moog and ARP, however that wasn't a good thing since people like the
grittier Moog sound. E-mu's systems made excellent alternatives to other
big name classic modulars. Unlike most others which almost always had
black panels, the E-mu modulars featured bright and shiny 1/8"" aluminum
panels with nice blue lines separating each module. Vince Clarke,
Herbie Hancock, Pat Gleeson, Hans Zimmer, Meat Beat Manifesto, Frank 
Zappa and Roger Linn have used it.The color photograph above was originally taken by the late Ed Rudnick:
""It was April of 1973 when the first E-mu modular synthesizer was sold
to future Director of Manufacturing Ed Rudnick, who had started hanging
around E-mu looking for a job so he could learn how to design and build
synthesizers. E-mu spent most of the 1970's designing ultrastable VCOs,
lab-quality filters, digital/analog sequencers, dedicated music ICs, and
polyphonic voltage control keyboards."" - E-mu's Corporate History Page

characteristics. In other words, you can morph between different sounds
and vary the balance of the morph between these sounds. Go from analog
drones that fade into high strings, for example.The Morpheus is a digital rackmount synthesizer. It features complete
16-channel MIDI implementation that can control most parameters as well.
The Morpheus is also easy and intuitive to operate. This plus a dual

61-note keyboard, the desktop sequencing all-in-one Command Station may
be what you need. There are 13 large velocity and aftertouch sensitive
pads which can be used to play notes, chords or drop in drum sounds.
Sequences can be recorded in real-time, step input, or grid-styled
classic TR drum-machine style programming. Patterns can be up to 32 bars
long each, there is quantization, overdubbing features, and synth
parameters can be automated in pattern and song modes.There are 16
front panel real-time controllers for automating parameters in your
tracks, or just for easy hands-on access to programming your sounds.
Mute/Enable Track buttons allow you to add or remove patterns on the
fly.  The sequencer has full-blown MIDI implementation as well,
supporting up to 32 MIDI channels. Use the MP-7 as a sound module or
sync it up to other MIDI equipment. You can control its built-in sounds
and  external devices simultaneously! Many rhythmic synth parameters
(LFO, envelopes) are Tempo/MIDI syncable too. There's even a cool

synth and sampler modules. In 1989, the Proteus was the first rack-mount
module E-mu produced, and it was a huge success for the company. The
Proteus 1 is an economical one-space module consisting of your basic
rock and pop sounds. It has 4 MB of sounds from the EIII library such as samples of pianos, organs,
strings, horns, guitars, basses, drums, Latin percussion, and more all
at your fingertips. The Proteus offers professional features such as
full 16-part MIDI multitimbrality, 32-voice polyphony, 16-bit ROM
samples, six individual polyphonic outputs and extensive editing and
modulation capabilities. There is also E-mu's RMidiPatchS that allows
direct real-time control of over 40 parameters for keyboard, midi
controllers, internal LFOs and envelopes. It has been used by Astral
Projection, Pet Shop Boys, Vangelis, Genesis, and Information
Society.Proteus 1 Pop/RockProteus 1 Plus Orchestral The Proteus 1 model was expandable with an additional 4 MB of
orchestral samples (from the Proteus 2), making it a Proteus 1 Plus
Orchestral. This gave you 4 MB of Pop/Rock sounds plus 4 MB of
Orchestral sounds - 384 patches total! Presumably, when the Plus 1
Orchestral came out, the original Proteus 1 took on the Pop/Rock label
to make it perfectly obvious what sounds each Proteus 1 model came
loaded with.Proteus 2 Orchestral (1990)In 1990, the Proteus 2 was released which is identical to the Proteus
1 in most every way except that it has 4 MB of purely orchestral sounds
- the same sounds from the Plus Orchestral ROM card, which also happen
to come from the EIII library. This was the first time really high
quality sounding orchestral sounds could be had in a dedicated sound module.Proteus 2 XR (1990)The standard Proteus 1 and 2 could be upgraded to XR versions
(extended RAM) as well. These doubled the RAM and memory up to 8MB,
adding another 192 of user patches (128 preset / 64 user) for a total of
384 patches.Proteus 3 World Instruments (1991)The Proteus 3 is identical to the previous Proteus models except that
it features an ethnic World set of sounds. It's full of 16-bit samples
(4 MB expandable to 8 MB via an XR upgrade) of shofars, flutes, celtic
harps, tablas, tamburas, banjos, didjeridoos, bagpipes, etc. Proteus FX (1994)A Proteus FX module is also available. It features sounds from both
the rock pop and orchestral modules. It also adds two digital effects
processors with reverb, delay, chorus and more. Surprisingly, the FX
surpasses other Proteus models in many ways but it is also the least
expensive model! It features 8 MB of sounds standard, and up to 512
patches. But what it doesn't have, is six polyphonic outputs. Just your
basic stereo L/R(mono) output.",

processor is the same as in the Proteus 2000, but is only 16-part
multitimbral instead of 32-part. The Proteus 1000 makes a great
entry-level sound module as it provides the full gamut of general
synthesizer sounds and is quite affordable. Serious musicians would
prefer the more flexible Proteus 2500 (or even the Proteus 2000) to the
1000 simply for the multiple outputs and increased polyphony and sound
expansion options.Current E-mu sound modules ship with one 32 MB sound-set each, but are

paved the way for such greats as the E-mu SP-1200 and AKAI MPC series of sampling drum machines.
Redesigned from E-mu's original Drumulator drum machine, the SP-12 is a
classic drum machine with built in sampling capability. There is a set
of preset drum sounds including kick, snare, hihats, toms, cymbals,
handclap and rimshot. These sounds can be mixed and edited using the
sliders. Then you can add your own beats and drum sounds using the
built-in 12-bit sampler. Sampling time is limited to only a few seconds
and the quality is very lo-fi (a sound loved by lo-fi and trip hop).
Store your patterns and link them into songs, there's room for 100 of
each! There are mono and individual outputs (no stereo). It's been used
by Madlib, Large Professor, Chicago, and DJ Premiere.The SP-12 was quickly superceded by the SP-1200 in 1987 which was continuously reissued
through 1997. The SP-1200 is undoubtedly the more popular of the two
since it has added features and emphasized sampling by eliminating the
preset drum sounds. However, for the classic synth collector the SP-12
still makes a great gift!",

specs: 26.040 kHz and 12-bit resolution. However the dirtiness of that sound
is great for hip hop and house music. They say it sounds like ""old
vinyl""... It features groove quantizing and a disk drive for sample
storage. As an upgraded version of the 1985 SP-12, the SP-1200 focused on its coolest feature
- sampling. The preset drum sounds of the SP-12 were omitted, leaving
room for up to 32 user samples of your own custom sampled and edited
drum sounds.Although this machine was originally released in 1987, E-mu has reissued
them again and again due to popular demand. They continued producing
them until they ran out of the SSM filter chips they used, around 1998.
It was just too legendary to give up as it was THE beat machine
for old-school rap and hip hop! In 1997 a final reissued model was 
released with a cooler looking all-black case. With the SP-1200

the XL-7 uses the same sample-playback synthesis engine as E-mu's Proteus 2000 sound module. The XL-7 and all
its Electronica synth sounds and beats can also be found in a sleek
keyboard version called the XK-6 Xtreme
Keys.Sharing its sounds and specs with the Xtreme Lead-1, the XL-7 has 128
voices of polyphony like the Xtreme Turbo. It ships with one 32 MB ROM
soundset called ""X-Lead"" and it is full of brand new and classic
electronica, techno, house, dance type sounds from basses and synths to
drum kits, scratches, vocal effects and more! The XL-7 has 3 additional
slots for adding more, up to 128 MB, of E-mu's 32 MB ROM soundsets from
E-mu's family of genre based sound modules, keyboards, and desktop
groove machines.What sets the XL-7 (and the MP-7 Urban/HipHop
version as well) apart from its sound-module and keyboard versions is
its built-in MPC-style sequencer. If you find the rack-mount sound
modules too constricting to work with, and don't have room for another
61-note keyboard, the desktop sequencing all-in-one Command Station may
be what you need. There are 13 large velocity and aftertouch sensitive
pads which can be used to play notes, chords or drop in drum sounds.
Sequences can be recorded in real-time, step input, or grid-styled
classic TR drum-machine style programming. Patterns can be up to 32 bars
long each, there is quantization, overdubbing features, and synth
parameters can be automated in pattern and song modes. There are 16
front panel real-time controllers for automating parameters in your
tracks, or just for easy hands-on access to programming your sounds.
Mute/Enable Track buttons allow you to add or remove patterns on the
fly.  The sequencer has full-blown MIDI implementation as well,
supporting up to 32 MIDI channels. Use the XL-7 as a sound module or
sync it up to other MIDI equipment. You can control its built-in sounds
and  external devices simultaneously! Many rhythmic synth parameters
(LFO, envelopes) are Tempo/MIDI syncable too. There's even a cool
real-time assignable touch strip ribbon controller. Unfortunately, the
sequencer stores up to 1024 patterns and 512 songs.Other great features it shares with its sister sound modules and
keyboard versions include 32 simultaneously available arpeggiators with
all the basic patterns plus up to 300 preset and user patterns! Two
effects processors offer up the standard batch of reverb, delay, chorus,
flange and distortion, and there are also digital 12 pole resonant
filters. There are six outputs and a digital S/PDIF output, USB port,
and a new BNC 12V lamp socket for lighting up the unit while using it on
stage or alongside the DJ's turntables! The XL-7 gives musicians and DJs
alike an MPC-style take on working with the proven sounds of E-mu's
genre based Dance synths!Current E-mu sound modules ship with one 32 MB sound-set each, but are

series and Yamaha's new digital DX-series. The AX60 is a programmable
six-voice synth with a nice LFO, lowpass (VCF) filter, envelope sections,
and more. An eight-voice version, the AX80,
was already available.Programming this synth is easy using dedicated sliders, knobs and/or
buttons for its parameters. It also has a useful noise generator and
some other cool functions that include auto-tuning, chorus, a multi-mode
arpeggiator and a keyboard that can be split into two key-zones, making
it somewhat bi-timbral. All six voices can be stacked in unison mode for
a powerful and thick lead sound. Its features and sound make the AX60 a
worthy alternative to Roland's Juno
106. The AX60 may have been used by Bjork.",

considered to be widely underrated and deserving of some recognition.
It's a six voice analog synthesizer with an almost identical
architecture to Akai's AX60 keyboard. It also
came in a rack-mount form as the VX90. It has
one oscillator (VCO) per voice and allows for 3 playing modes: Poly mode
uses one VCO per voice for six voice polyphonic pads, chords and
strings. Dual-VCO mode stacks 2 VCOs per voice for a thicker three-voice
sound. Unison mode stacks all six VCOs onto one monophonic voice for a
screamin' lead!The AX73 has a simple 24 dB/oct VCF (filter) and it has an interesting
feature that allows the cutoff to be modulated by the VCO. It also has a
flexible LFO with many variable waveforms, chorus, portamento, and a
standard ADSR VCA envelope generator. But unlike many other analog
synths, this machine is MIDI equipped for easy integration and use in
today's modern studios. The sounds are quite nice and are adequate for
use in any style of music production. It also had special inputs for use
with Akai's S-612, S-900
and S-950 samplers, allowing you to run those samples through the
AX73's analog filters and envelopes.",

LCD bar-graph displays running across the top of the keyboard. Two
analog oscillators per voice plus a sub oscillator provide the basis of
its punchy analog sounds that can be described as similar to a Chroma Polaris or Roland Juno 106. Very good bass, brass,
synth sounds, and effects are possible. However its strings are average
at best.The blue and orange florescent LCD displays use a simple and intuitive
bar-graph format to show all its parameters and values, making for one
of the best on-board displays ever! You have to wonder, however, with
such a cool display, why couldn't they have included dedicated sliders
and knobs for each parameter (see the AX60). A
decent amount of patch storage and nice enough sounds make the AX80 a
useable synth to have around, but it probably won't replace your Roland
Juno. Other notable features of the AX80 include an angled rear panel
for easy cable connections, chord memory, MIDI control, and pitch/mod
wheels. It's been used by Mark Bell (LFO) on Bjork's Homogenic.",

gear. However, you can use it to process any sound source since it
has basic 1/4"" inputs and outputs and MIDI! It has genuine analog
filters for that warmer tone with Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, and Notch filter types.
It consists of a MONO filter section and STEREO filter section. The MONO section 
offers 2-, 4-, and 8-pole filter slopes.
The STEREO section offers 2- and 4-pole filter slopes. The MONO 8-pole slope utilizes the whole
filter circuitry so the STEREO section is not active. Likewise, the MONO section
is inactive when the STEREO section is in 4-pole mode. But when both sections are
used simultaneously, they can be linked so that the MONO filter's control knobs control both
MONO and STEREO sections. The link can also be inverted so the two sections sweep in
opposite directions.Other features include one ADSR envelope for the filter's contour. This envelope can be triggered
by MIDI and Trigger button, but not by audio unfortunately. The LFO is essential to bringing this filter to life!
It has four waveforms including sawtooth, square, triangle and random. It can be synced
to MIDI clock and can modulate to 16th, 8th, 1/4, 1/2, whole, double-whole, and triplet notes
in tempo with your MPC (or MIDI) sequences! Or use the ""Tap"" button to tap in the tempo in real-time.
A large numeric display shows the current tempo and 
there's also an EQ on-board for global sonic fine-tuning.
Effects include a very harsh (in a good way) Distortion and stereo analog Phase Shifter. The ins-and-outs consist
of three 1/4"" inputs (mono/stereo), stereo phono (RCA) inputs, stereo 1/4"" outputs, stereo phono (RCA) outputs,
and MIDI in, out and through. All pertinent knobs and buttons can send and receive MIDI control.Clearly the MFC42 is for DJ's and musicians alike. It can be rack-mounted into
any studio's rack, DJ's turn-table coffin, or specially mounted to any MPC60 through 3000. It's a perfect add-on for any MPC-user and 
is an affordable alternative to other Filter
boxes such as the Mutator, Sherman Filterbank, 
Electrix Filter Factory, and Waldorf

four times that of the MPC2000. It is also a lot smaller so you can just
pop it in your bag and head off to a gig. Another great thing about the
MPC1000 is that it stores its data in the form of WAV file samples and
MIDI file sequences on Standard Compact Flash Cards (up to 2GB), and
samples and sequences can easily be dropped onto the card or backed up
to Mac or PC via the USB port on the back of the MPC1000.Cheaping out a little on some of the build quality - but not the sound

Amidst the euphoria of the ""New Analog Revolution"" of the 2010's, where analog electronic instruments had not only come screaming back with a vengeance, but they howled at a price anyone could afford, Akai unleashed a product that seemingly hummed the anthem of ""instant classic"". Its' specs read like something any self-respecting synth-geek should be hiding under the mattress, lest their mother find it.
Full VCO, analog four voice drum machine, with one voice, variable Saw/Square, resonant VCF packing, envelope shaper equipped bass synth. It seemed to be an 808 and 303 all in one box for the lowest price one could be charged and still take it seriously. Was this going to be the ""genre creating"", ""Mojo Box"" for the new generation of electronic musicians?
In what ended up being as much a biopsy of ""internet culture"" as a review of a musical instrument, the question was answered with a resounding ""NO!"" when a Youtube reviewer's rant went viral. In this video, a disgruntled and disheveled youth spouted venom at Akai's new product as if it had done him some deep personal wrong. It turned out one video wasn't enough, soon part two appeared, providing a seething, bookend to his first damning installment. In the day or two that had passed, his mood hadn't improved.
Unfortunately for Akai, the videos were entertaining to a large segment of the instrument-buying population, and it seemed no one could watch the video without adopting the opinion of the reviewer. The Rhythm Wolf was D.O.A, it's competitive price insured some sales, but these led to copycat videos and before long it was accepted as fact that the Rhythm Wolf was a dud, whether anyone had actually tried it for themselves or not. Did it deserve this bad reputation? Or was it the first electronic musical instrument to fall victim to the ""online bullying"" phenomenon?
First, let's examine the specs and what is universally agreed upon concerning the Rhythm Wolf, be it good or ill.
As advertised, it is a four-drum voice, one synth voice, VCO analog, electronic groovebox/sequencer. Examining it straight out of the box, its superior build quality is unquestioned, even by its critics. It is a solid and weighty unit that has certainly been built to last, and though close examination reveals ""fake"" real-wood-sides (plastic made to look like wood) the sturdiness of the instrument itself has never been questioned and is a pleasant surprise in this price range.
Moving left to right, each individual voice has a column of four parameter dials that range down to an MPC type velocity sensitive pad assigned to that voice only. It should also be noted that only 3 stages of velocity: Hard, Medium, Soft, are available -- there are no shades of grey in between. So a tap with a ""CC"" velocity value of 30-90 will all sound soft, 91-110 medium and 111-127 hard. All ""CC"" values in between the threshold numbers will sound at the same velocity.
Each voice's dials offer parameters unique to that voice. They are as follows:
Kick Drum: Volume, Tune, Attack, Decay,
Snare Drum: Volume, Tune, Noise, Decay
Percussion: Volume, High tune, Noise, Low tune
High Hat (Note that the High Hat is given two pads, one for open one for closed. The only real difference being that the decay is delayed on the ""Open hat"" pad)
Volume, Tune, Decay
Bass Synthesizer: Volume, Tune, Filter Cut off, Envelope amount, Filter Resonance, Decay. (There is also a switch that allows the user to choose between a Saw and a Square wave)
Finally, at the far right there are two ""Global control"" knobs:
Volume, Howl (Howl is Akai-speak for Overdrive, turning this knob overdrives the entire unit and effects all voices)
The disappointments begin early as the kick drum is a flaccid and, indeed, a barely audible affair that sends one reaching for the attack knob first thing. The dismal news continues as one realizes that whether it's tune or attack (volume and decay function normally) these parameter knobs barely effect the sound at all, this is a problem found throughout the device, but is felt the hardest here. The kick lacks a snappy transient and there is nothing the user can do about it. New users no doubt, having begun their exploration of the Wolf with visions of analog 808 and 909 kicks in their minds are bitterly disappointed, and justifiably so. It feels that no matter what you do, the kick is never present enough, how Akai let the Wolf out to pasture with such weak toothed kick is beyond comprehension.
Things pick up considerably in the neighboring snare voice. Though the tune knob is barely good for a few semi-tones, the oscillator produces an excellent ""Thud"" at 200 Hz and the white noise generator produces a piercing but never annoying whiplash of sizzle at both long and short decay levels.
Next is the appealing but odd ""Percussion"" voice, as it seems to be nothing more than a DIFFERENT approach to snare, the high and low tune knobs dial two separate pitches to the user's desired interval, while the noise and decay knobs provide the same white noise burst and dispersion as the neighbouring snare voice did.
The Hats are a split decision. Once again the tune knob seems only good for a slight shift in tone, the decay comes as advertised. Between the two pads for open and closed respectively, the hats do not disappoint or thrill.
Lastly, we come to the Synth voice and perhaps the most damning piece of evidence against the Rhythm Wolf. The Bass synth's pitch tracking is improperly set, thus the ""Hard"" sequencer/ Shift function buttons below the pads, which serve triple duty as ""piano"" keys play their assigned pitches audibly out of tune, rendering the bass synth useless. Another method of playing pitches, namely playing the bass synth's singular pad and twisting the tempo dial for pitch change proves no more effective.
Let it be known, that, within a few months, Akai released a ""Tuning App"" for the Wolf's synth. It does a passable job and gets the pitch tracking right for a period of time, but it must be run multiple times, and the synth will start to drift back out if it isn't used every 25 minutes or so. Also, with the lightning pace of computer OS changes and Akai's abandoning of this product, a day will come soon when modern computers can no longer run the ""Tuning App."" When that day comes, either a benevolent programmer will create a third party app for it, or the Wolf's synth voice will be forever useless.
The synth voice itself is pleasingly rich in either Saw or Square form, though, disappointingly, the filter resonance cannot be turned all the way up because the last 20% will dive-bomb the voice's volume out of Audible range.  The envelope amount knob is more of an envelope delay control, that adjusts when the envelope's attack occurs, cut-off and decay function as expected.
Moving to the global knobs, one is glad to find volume does as it promises, the Howl (overdrive) knob, however, is a curious affair. Firstly, it is as noisy as the day is long, but it is also only effective for the first 40% after that, no amount of discernible change can be detected.
The sequencer is a simple but well-endowed affair. The drums transmit on MIDI Channel 10, with fixed note numbers, so no changing them to fit in better with other gear. The synth transmits hard on channel 1 and includes a ""note-tie"" feature, that keeps the envelope open while consecutive notes play.
There are 16 banks with 16 step ""A"" and ""B"" Patterns each pattern also includes a ""fill"" which can be triggered by hand to substitute for the entire pattern, one for each. Thus making each of the 16 banks essentially 64 step-patterns, triplets and variable swing are all available, as are grid resolutions (in either regular notes or triplets) from 1/4 to 1/32. The sequencer is no disappointment.
Finally, there are two outputs. One will carry the entire mix through the overdrive FX unless a 1/4 jack is plugged into the other ""Synth out"" jack, under these conditions the synth will NOT pass through the overdrive through the drums still will.
In conclusion the Rhythm Wolf has some egregious flaws, but it also has a scruffy charm that some will find irresistible, after playing with one is easy to see the proper comparison would have been a CR78 or other 70's groove box, not an 808 or 909, it is primitive, it is flawed, but it is also a unique and curious piece of gear, something we may not see enough of these days. If you want some dirt old-school analog splat and aren't afraid of the wild tuning irregularities and vanishing kick drum, then perhaps you have what it takes to tame the Akai Rhythm Wolf.

Yeah, it's pretty weak, but for the time it was an excellent entry-level sampler or even as an addition to your S-1000, S-1100 or MPC2000. Sampling specs are 16-bit and 32 kHz (not cd-quality). The sampler only records samples in mono. Built-in 3.5 floppy disk drive lets you store your samples or load from libraries (it has no SCSI interface). The eight trigger buttons on the front correspond to each of the 8 samples you can have and can be used to trigger them. You can truncate your samples, transpose and loop and even reverse them. The S01 features two MIDI inputs, which can be switched with a switch on the front panel. There's one mono sample input, one mono output and one headphone output at the front panel and one mono output at the back. Playback and sampling can be controlled with an additional foot-switch.",

be interchanged with higher-end Akai samplers or loaded onto a computer

absolutely no onboard effects whatsoever and a rather poor built-in
sequencer. It is also worth noting that the unit uses RCA jacks instead
of 1/4 inch stereo plugs, which may be useful to some and irritating to
others. Nonetheless, pair the S20 up with a decent sequencer and an
outboard effects box or filter (if desired) and you've got a nice,
cheap, and functional little sampler.",

However, in a classic case of ""the whole being greater than the parts,"" the Timbre Wolf's smooth DCO oscillators and off-beat functionality, in an increasingly conformist synthesizer market, have caused many to change their minds about this oddly-charming device.
The Timbre Wolf was unleashed on the all-to-suspecting public at N.A.M.M 2015 in a legendary product demo, that is best described as the Hindenburg of Synthesizer debuts. The public was already out for Akai’s blood after their analog drum machine/bass synth, The Rhythm Wolf, released a year prior, had been sent to market with its oscillator pitch increments improperly scaled and thus unable to properly produce pitch and a kick drum that was unusually murky.
A firestorm of online venom had been directed at the company, who had already started production on a separate product featuring 4 of the Rhythm Wolf’s synth voices. The release was delayed to let the vitriol die down, but it only whetted the public’s appetite for a sacrificial goat (or wolf, in this case.) At N.A.M.M 2015 an obviously terrified and underprepared Akai employee nervously fumbled with the unresponsive Timbre Wolf as thousands mocked from their online vantage points. Commercially, the product was predictably D.O.A with prices steadily falling to below bargain levels, Akai quickly moved on from its ill-fated analog line.
Is the Timbre Wolf deserving of the derision it received upon release? To judge the synth one must first understand its' functions…
.. The Timbre Wolf's lineage can be traced back to 1981 and Korg's ""curious"" but, for the most part, well-remembered Mono/Poly analog synthesizer. One might even call the Timbre Wolf a modern copy of the aforementioned Korg.
Like the Mono/Poly, each of the Timbre Wolf's four voices is addressed individually via a channel strip of controls for that voice only. Volume, Tune, Filter cut-off and Envelope amount (Filter envelope) are the parameters offered for tweaking.  It also comes equipped with a wave-shaping switch that toggles between saw and square. From there, the user could let the voice move through a shared overdrive circuit (amount of overdrive is controlled by a single knob destined to be the butt of 10,0000 punchlines, Akai's ubiquitous ""howl"" knob) and on through the synth's final shared VCA to its monophonic balanced output jack. Akai claims the main out to be balanced TRS +4, however many users have claimed this NOT to be the case.  In comparison to its sister products, The Rhythm Wolf and Tom Cat drum machines, which play audio over both the ""+ and -"" of a TRS connection, the Timbre Wolf only plays audio over the ""+"". This leads to speculation that there may be manufacturing differences and that not all units are identical, so take care in assessing the output's behavior should you find yourself using one.  One also has the option of using a direct, pre-overdrive, individual output which Akai has supplied for each of its four voices.
This is where things get interesting, as one understands that the Timbre Wolf can function as four independent monophonic synthesizers, each with it’s own output and MIDI channel, one Polyphonic Synthesizer (where each voice, unfortunately, must be addressed on it’s own MIDI channel, thus polyphonic playing from a controller becomes cumbersome) or as one four oscillator mono synth addressable on one MIDI channel (which leaves three other MIDI channels open for external sequencing) These modes are easily selected via a front panel switch.
Additional sound shaping and sequencing perks include each channel having its own 16-step sequencer with an additional B pattern, which can be run sequentially, thus creating a 32 step sequence, there is also a fill (Variation) button. This provides access to an alternate sequence for the A and B sequencer patterns, allowing the quick of hand (fill patterns must be triggered manually) access to four 64 step XOX style patterns for controlling the internal voice. Also, in monophonic mode, the sequencer will rotate through the voices ""Round Robin"" style, as each voice's sound can be dialed individually. This can produce some interesting sonic variations, not the least of which is a 303 substitute.
There is variable swing, note ties, triplets, extensive voice priority settings and an “Auto-tune” function to calm the fears of any Rhythm Wolf owners. There is also a Pitch bend wheel that disappointingly travels a full tone and no further.
The Timbre Wolf has been criticized for the lack of response it’s onboard controls provide, the tuning knob is useful only for detuning in unison mode as intervals cannot be achieved via its use. Further to this, the filter cut-off knob, when nearing its apex, seems to drop the overall volume below a usable level.
But in spite of its controversial birth, a commercial failure, and initial criticism, few have ever said that it is a bad sounding synthesizer. Most agree its raw tones are quite pleasing and that it harkens back to some of the more obscure synthesizers of the 70’s.
What esteem, if any, the Timbre Wolf achieves in a historical sense will not be known for many years. What is known is that, if you don’t mind a bit of a challenge and are willing to try and do a lot with a little, then the Akai Timbre Wolf may hold some appeal for you. However alluring this challenge may sound, it would be best for most for most of today’s synthesizer market to understand that this instrument will most likely not provide them with the type of modern sounds they are looking for and they would do well to demo it prior to purchase.",

can use it to store your samples or load samples from libraries for
Akai's S-612, S-700 and X7000. Editing samples
is straight forward and makes this synth a great entry-level sampler.
However, the LCD display is small so editing can be tedious. It also
features a cool analog-like filter with cutoff. But for enhanced
analog-like editing, the X7000 can be hooked up to the AX73, AX60 and VX90 synthesizers via the DD-X5013 Voice Cable so
you can run the X7000's samples through these synth's analog circuitry.The built-in keyboard makes the X7000 good for performances and it also
makes a good first Keyboard for any budding musicians looking to get
into sampling - either for cheap or for some lo-fi sampling. However, it
does have advanced functions for users looking for some more elaborate
or malleable sounds. These include the multi-sampling and re-sampling
functions, sample reversing and alternating, keyboard splitting, and the
option to upgrade using the Expansion Memory PCB which increases the
number of samples available to 16 and boosts multi-sampling from 6 to 16
splits. There was also a rack-mount version, the S-700, also a few leaps
ahead of the original S-612 but also still a
couple steps behind the classic S-900. The

The purpose was to give the organist/keyboardist some Bass Guitar and Synthesizer sounds they could incorporate into their performances. It is a monophonic analog synth with funky controls, decent sounds and a unique character. The Bass Guitar sound is actually very realistic, really capturing the sound of an electric bass guitar or acoustic bass. It has an attack control called ""On"" that lets you adjust the initial attack to make it sound like a picked bass or a fingered bass. A ""Damp"" control is essentially a sustain envelope that can be used to create more of a muted bass sound.The Synthesizer section is pretty basic, and definitely designed using organ player lingo as opposed to synth player lingo. There a five flute stops (sine) from 16', 8', 4', 2', to 1', two brass stops (sawtooth) at 16' and 8' and a woodwind stop (square) at 8'. Multiple stops and waveforms can be simultaneously engaged to create more complex tones. These waveform sections, as well as the Bass Guitar section, have independent volume controls to balance their mix.There is a filter section—a formant filter referred to as ""Wah-Wah""—that the brass (sawtooth) and woodwind (square) waveforms can be effected by in either automatic or manually adjusted modes using the ""Wah-Wah"" slider. No frequency cutoff or resonance knobs or anything usual like that here. Just an ""On"" switch, direction switch (""Up/Down""), a manual switch and a ""Rotor"" (auto) switch. A simple envelope section is available with attack and sustain parameters.A unique ""Glide"" slider can be used to pitch shift the keyboard by an entire octave. The octave shift can also be automated up or down at variable speed. A really interesting feature is the ""Hawaii"" button—an intermittent switch that drops the pitch by a half-tone. It is effectively like a pitch bend but only goes down and at a quick fixed rate. A Vibrato effect is available as well, with rate and depth controls and either continuous or delayed modes.The WERSI Bass Synthesizer was available in kit form but also came pre-assembled with many keyboard/manual options. The idea being that you could connect it to the keyboard or pedals of your organ, or you could choose from WERSI's 13-, 25-, and 30-pedal claviers. WERSI provided connector kits and a wiring diagram to help connect your own keyboard or pedals to a 16-pin connector interface on the rear of the unit. It was encased in a carry-case-style chassis with a handle and cover.If looking to buy one of these, potential units should be closely examined, as the original assembly may have been done by the factory or second hand. As a result, a unit may not always be fully functional. Also, some units may have been modified over the years with the original push buttons and knobs replaced by alternative switches and knobs. Other things to consider: is the cover included, are any of the pedal board and connector kit options available and are the owner's manual and assembly instructions available.Although the model pictured above (taken from a Wersi product brochure) calls it the ""Bassie"" on the front panel, they almost all usually say ""Baß Synthesizer"" on the front panel. That ß symbol is just another funky quirk of this synth—it's from the German alphabet for the ""ss"" sound. The model designation of the Bass Synthesizer was AP-6 (usually printed below the power cord socket), so you may also see it referred to as the Wersi AP-6.",

Yes, it's a real
analog modular with real patch points, not some sort of fake connection
points like in that controller with the shape of an MS-20 in the Legacy Collection. The bC16 can be cryptic at first, with no printed layout to describe
the functions of the knobs, no description of the 25 patch points and
just three blinking lights. But that's the whole of the
bC16-experimentation. You can try just about any connection point with
one of the ten provided 2mm mini banana patch cords. After a while you
get very accustomed to this micro-modular. Lets face it, with 1 ADSR, 1
LFO, 1 VCA, and 1 VCO (actually two linked VCO's) you can't really
lose yourself. For its bargain price it's also a very good contender
for use with other modular or semi-modular systems to add flexibility to
them-need a resettable LFO for your MS-20? You got one here. Want a
second ADSR for your Sherman Filterbank?
You can find one in the bC16 (although you would have to make your own
mini banana adapter). The bC16 is battery powered via six AAA batteries
or by an external 9 to 12v source.The linked oscillator is a very clever way to have two oscillators
without another bundle of knobs. One VCO knob can adjust how detuned
they are while another knob selects which waveform you want for both, or
in some combination. Because the bC16 is battery powered, the VCO
responds to a unique 0.586v/octave (5v/8.5 octave=0.586v/octave) control
voltage signal. All the other modules respond to a more typical +/-
5v signal. The headphone amp is very noisy, though you can get around
that when recording by using a mini-banana adapter to use the direct
output of the voltage-controlled amp.But beware, while it can do some basic synth applications, its main
strength is to provide a powerful array of synth-FX sounds. Because of
the ability of the synth to run by itself, you don't necessarily need a
MIDI connection to make sounds with this tiny modular. And there's a
lot of fun to be had with it-keep your sampler handy to sample whatever
weird sounds you may find. For its price, it's a great and versatile
device, which you can learn from without costing yourself an arm and a
leg.This synth has been used by Depeche Mode on their album
""Sounds of the Universe"" in the songs: ""In Chains"", ""Little Soul"",
""Peace"", ""In Sympathy"", ""Sun + Moon and Stars"".",

sliders for the left hand (lower split) and another five for the right
hand (upper split).There is also a sixth sound: Bass. The Bass sound has its own volume
slider as well, but it is assigned to only the bottom 27 notes of the
keyboard. It is also not the greatest of Bass sounds either, and can
sometimes muddy the sound.There is a filter section but only for the Brass. It uses some pretty
old-fashioned terminology: 'Emphasis' for resonance and 'Contour'
for cutoff. There are also Attack and Decay controls for the filter.
There is another filter for the Cello and Violin string sounds called
'Timbre' which can adjust between a 'Mellow' to 'Bright'
sound—basically it's a highpass filter. There is a 'Vibrato'
effect section, basically the LFO, with 'Speed' and 'Depth'
controls. The only global envelope control is a 'Sustain' length
slider.The Orchestrator's best sounds are its Brass (probably because it is
the sound with the voltage controlled filter) and the Strings. In fact the Strings
sound very similar to the famous ARP
Solina. Unfortunately there are no built-in Ensemble effects to
really sweeten them up...but that's what outboard gear is for!Like most synthesizers of its time, the Orchestrator was built with
the performing musician in mind. It is its own flight-case! Its casing
is very tough and durable, it has a handle and a cover/lid to keep it
protected during transport. And if it looks heavy, it is! Additional
options for the Orchestrator included an organ-like 13-note (G-G) Foot
Pedal Board, Sustain Pedal, and a Foot Expression Pedal controller for
the filter cutoff. There are no CV/Gate options, just connectors for the
external pedal controllers.",

compact with just 49 keys. But it is fully polyphonic - you can play all
49 notes simultaneously! Programming is simple and clearly laid-out with
just 15 sliders and a few buttons. A solid black chassis and wood end-cheeks round out this
classic and often overlooked string machine.The Performer is best remembered for its Strings. A simple 3-band
equalizer with high, mid and low sliders can be used to give the strings
shimmering sparkle or moody dark timbres. The Strings section uses two
oscillators per voice with 8' and 16' settings. Simple Attack and
Sustain sliders give you some control of your string's envelope settings.The Brass section is less exciting. It uses a single oscillator with
just a square wave to generate a weak Brass sound. It has a low-pass voltage-controlled
filter with resonance, but it too is pretty weak. Simple Attack and
Decay sliders control its limited envelope settings too.The LFO is pretty nice, with delay length, rate and depth control. It
can modulate both Brass and String sections and can be routed either to the
VCF or pitch. There are three outputs on the back: main output, brass output
and signal output (for external processing) as well as CV and Gate
connections. It has been used by Duran Duran.",

considerably more flexible than the latter. It has a basic 37-note
keyboard without velocity or aftertouch. The two oscillators feature
basic sawtooth, triangle and square waves and can be synced together.The filter section is very nice featuring low-, high- and band-pass
filters and switchable 12dB or 24dB slopes. Other features of the filter
include an independent envelope with inverted and normal ADSR, key
tracking and single or multiple triggering of the filter. Some other
features of the Spirit include a built-in ring-modulator, an Arpeggiator
with 3 different patterns and that can be linked to the LFO, and there's
an external audio input for running external sounds through its filters,
LFOs or Ring Mod.For the hands-on approach, the Spirit is sure to please. There are 24
knobs, 10 switches and 15 sliders to start. There are 3 performance
wheels for controlling the Pitch, Mod-X and Shaper-Y modulation effects
(see LFO specs below). Using those with the Arpeggiator can get pretty
wild. The Arpeggiator features 3 modes: Ripple (Up/Down), Arpeggio (Up
several octaves) and Leap (Goes up 1 and then 4 octaves). There are also
Auto and preset Glide modes for getting some elasticity or bending
effects. Since all the LFOs, envelopes and filters are quite flexible

version of the Crumar Trilogy. It is basically two synths in one: a
Synthesizer and an Organ synth, which can be played separately or both
at the same time. There are independent master volume knobs for the
Synthesizer and Organ sections. The Organ section features four
horizontal drawbars to adjust the volumes of each of the 4 octaves (2',
4', 8' and 16').The Stratus is a 6-note polyphonic analog that uses the highly
popular CEM chips that have also been used in other popular synths of
the time including Jupiters, OB-X synths, Prophets—even modern
Dave Smith Instruments. The Stratus has a total of two oscillators
(DCOs), and they’re fed through divide-down ICs, just like an organ or
string machine. The oscillators offer saw and square waveforms, or a mix
of the two, and a mono/unison mode. The two oscillators can be tuned
separately and synced. A unique option is the ""Alternate Saw/Sq"" mode
which alternates the voices between square and sawtooth
waveforms—play a chord and some voices will be square, others will
be saw, or bang out a solo and each note will be a different
waveform—definitely unique but maybe not always practical.What is special about the Stratus is that it has six VCFs and six
VCAs—one per voice. The filter has a nice warm sound and offers a good
amount of flexibility. It has cutoff, resonance, envelope amount
controls and and an external pedal control option. The LFO can do FM,
wah (when assigned to the VCF) or tremolo (when assigned to the VCA).
The LFO section also has adjustable slope and delay controls, an
uncommon but useful feature. Another uncommon but interesting feature is
the Octave Modulation mode, in which the LFO will apply square wave
pitch modulation over an entire octave, resulting in some pretty wild
sounds. The Oscillator Glide is a portamento effect with some extra
features besides the usual Amount and Speed controls. It can be set to
Mono or Multi trigger and has four direction modes. Finally, there is a
typical ADSR envelope generator section.The keyboard is a standard 49-note affair with no velocity or
aftertouch. A joystick controller left of the keyboard can be used as a
pitch bender that can also modulate the VCF and VCA sections. There are
independent outputs for the Organ and Synthesizer sections, pedal
control inputs for the filter, sustain pedal, and LFO sync. There is
also a TM Interface for use with the Steiner Master's Touch—a wind controller that can be
used to create pitch bends and vibratos using your breath. However,
there are no CV/Gate options.The Stratus does not have any sort of user patch memory. But it did
originally ship with preset template overlays. These were paper overlays
that you lay on to the face-plate (with cutouts for all the knobs) that
had markings to indicate where to set each knob in order to re-create a
certain preset or sound. See an image here.The Stratus is rare, has very unique features and it looks and sounds
really good too. And the included Organ section makes it stand out from
the other more conventional analog poly-synths of the time, such as the
Jupiters, Prophets and Oberheim OB-series. The Stratus (along with the
Trilogy) marks Crumar's transition from Organ builders to synthesizer
builders.",

This compact and affordable wavetable synthesizer boasts one of the most complex digital engines on the market and is well equipped to compete with other powerful digital synthesizers such as the Alesis Ion and Access Virus TI Snow. The Blofeld was first released in a stylish white desktop module and was followed up a year later with a four-octave keyboard version plus the addition of onboard sample RAM. Black versions of both models were also released. The Blofeld is descended from the Waldorf Q, Micro Q and Microwave II wavetable synthesizers (all of which were themselves descendants of the classic PPG Wave). It sports three oscillators per voice and two multi mode filters. All three oscillators have classic analog modeled waveforms, while Osc1 and Osc2 can also act as wavetable generators. The Blofeld features 68 wavetables, including tables from the Microwave II, Microwave XT, Q, Micro Q and PPG Wave. However, unlike its predecessors, the Blofeld can load two different wavetables into oscillators one and two, creating more complex and evolving sounds. Throw in the fact that user created wavetables can be loaded (via third party software) and the Blofeld clearly stands out as one of the most advanced wavetable synths of them all.In addition to the analog modeling and wavetable synthesis, there is oscillator syncing, ring modulation and a noise source with controllable color. All three oscillators can frequency modulate (FM) each other as well as both of the filters. When the sample RAM option is used (available standard on the keyboard model or as an expansion option for the desktop module), Osc1 and Osc2 can load user samples that act as regular sound sources (instead of the analog modeled waveforms or wavetables) for even more unique sound possibilities. Samples are loaded through the Spectre app where they can be freely assigned to the desired keys, even multisamples are supported. On the negative side, there is no velocity switching and it takes several minutes to load a sample set over USB, nor is it possible to change or load just a single sample in a set.There are two filters (configurable in series or parallel) with (2-pole or 4-pole) Low pass, Band pass, and High pass, as well as Notch, two screaming Comb filters and an emulation of the analog PPG Wave filter. Each filter has a Drive parameter with various different flavors. Filters are fully resonant and will go willingly into ear-piercing self oscillation. Overall, the filters sound great, from smooth to aggressive, even if they are merely digitally modeled affairs.Diving into the powerful 16-slot modulation matrix, the Blofeld turns into a digital modular monster where almost everything can control everything. And with three LFOs and four Envelopes (A-D1-S1-D2-S2-R type with loop-able segments) things can become pretty complex. You can even create your own modifiers by combining two mod sources and applying different operations to them (e.g. we can divide velocity by a note number and use the new value as a control parameter in the matrix).At the end of the synthesis chain are two effect slots. The effects are adequate (with a very nice Decimator and a second Drive stage) however the dreadful metallic Reverb should be avoided unless you are scoring some alien invasion sci-fi blockbuster and need the sound of a monster trapped in an air-conditioning duct...yikes! The Blofeld is fully multitimbral with up to 16 parts playing at once. Every part has its own MIDI channel, key and velocity range, so complex multitimbral setups are possible. Polyphony depends on the patch complexity and can reach up to 25 voices. The use of samples, wavetables and comb filters can potentially limit the polyphony to single digits. The Blofeld does not have an internal sequencer but it makes up for that with an extensive arpeggiator. Arpeggios of up to 16 steps can be programmed with individual settings of swing, glide, accent and note length for each step. Programmed arpeggios can be saved with each patch as well. Upon initial examination, the user interface seems limited with only seven control knobs and five buttons. But the programming interface is in fact intuitively designed and works well. Instead of dedicated knobs, it uses a matrix approach to parameter access, similar to that of the Micro Q or even the DSI Evolver, placing its most used parameters at hand with an easily navigated screen-based menu system to get to the deeper levels. For the traditional tweaks (labeled on the front panel), press the corresponding button and turn one of the four control knobs. For deeper editing, flip through the menu pages using the main encoder and then adjust the active parameters using the two knobs under the screen. In effect it is possible and practical to program new patches from scratch via the UI, which, given the complexity of the engine, is remarkable.While the sound engine is definitely first-class, the build quality is a mixed bag. Though its outer metal shell remains ridiculously tough (and heavy), connectors and knobs seem to be flimsy and prone to damage. The rotary encoders can skip values, USB can drop data and the overall feel seems to have been dictated by cost-saving decisions. On the other hand, the LED screen is excellent, clear and bright, and the keyboard version has a very nice key-bed with aftertouch plus pitch and mod wheels. Connections are limited to stereo audio out, headphone out, USB and MIDI in. The Keyboard version adds a sustain pedal input, MIDI out and an internal power supply. When introduced, the Blofeld's OS carried numerous bugs and glitches. However, Waldorf has been updating the OS with reasonable frequency and by v1.15 of the OS, almost every issue had been fixed and the Blofeld is stable and gig worthy.Sonically the Blofeld tends toward metallic, digital timbres, overdriven electric noises, earth shattering basses and icy pads. However, since the engine is enormously deep, almost any sound can be approximated with careful programming. It is probably not, however, the first choice for faithful analog recreations. On the other hand it can easily go where no analog synth has gone before and brings some wild flavors to the sonic table.Trivia: The Blofeld is named after the evil genius Bond villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The software used to create and transfer sample content to the Blofeld is named after his criminal organization SPECTRE.",

was undoubtedly PPG (Palm Products GmbH), fueled by the technology in
its wavetable based synthesizer, the Wave 2.x
series. But like most vintage synth makers, the company was fading.
Towards the end of the 1980's, PPG's technology and several of their employees joined Waldorf, another
German manufacturer, and the first product to come out of this collaboration was the Microwave, released
in 1989.The Microwave was built upon what was the PPG Wave. A digital/analog
hybrid in which digitally sampled wavetables are processed through
analog VCA envelope and VCF (filter) sections producing a classic and warm
yet highly complex sound. In fact, the Microwave uses the same
wavetables from the PPG Wave 2.3! In effect, the Microwave sounds like
the PPG, which in turn, sounds like synth-pioneers Tangerine
Dream. To lower production costs and simultaneously attempt to
make it more accessible to more musicians, the Microwave was packaged in
a two-unit rack module. It's a powerful instrument in a small and
unassuming package.Unfortunately, Waldorf streamlined its design a little too far. With
only a handful of on-board buttons and one parameter adjustment knob,
editing sounds was quite cumbersome and usually required some sort of
external editor to really dig into the power on-hand. Polyphony is slim
but decent at 8-voices. There are 64 on-board memory patches, plus
another 64 via external memory card. There are no on-board effects.Over the years, the operating system (OS) could be upgraded via EPROM
chips from Waldorf.  These added additional wavetables, the options to
create custom wavetables, a speech synthesizer, and numerous other
improvements. The final OS was version 2.0, released in 1994.A few years after the Microwave's introduction, a fully realized
knob-laden hands-on version of the sort of wavetable technology used
here came in the form of the Waldorf
Wave. Designed for the high-end synth market, the Wave represented
the pinnacle of Waldorf and PPG's wavetable synth technology in its
time. However, the success the Microwave found among
""every-day"" musicians was not lost on Waldorf, leading them to
release the much more common yet inferior
Microwave II in 1997. The mkII did
offer improved features in terms of effects and processing, however it
was a fully digital DSP-driven machine and thus, lacked the warmth and
character of the original Microwave. Microwaves have been used by
Nine Inch Nails, Hardfloor, Jimmy Edgar, Vangelis, and Crystal
Distortion.",

Waldorf's Microwave was updated to the new but not-so improved mkII
version in 1997. The original Microwave was a very popular and
powerful rack-mount synthesizer in a sparse and unassuming package. At its
heart lay a digital polyphonic wavetable synth engine that came straight
out of the legendary PPG Wave 2.x, which
was itself designed in part and used extensively by members of the
pioneering synth-group Tangerine Dream.The Microwave II has tons of waves/wavetables for shaping all kinds of sounds,
flexible resonant filters, a noise generator, a ring modulator, a
programmable rhythmic arpeggiator, and effects! While the original
Microwave was a powerful synth held back only by its restrained interface and
lack of additional features (only 8-voice polyphony, no effects, no easy hands-on
editing), the mkII did attempt to address some of the former's issues.
However Waldorf made its biggest faux-pas by replacing the original's
analog filters and envelopes with digital emulations.The Microwave II upped polyphony to 10-voices. Hardly a major
improvement after eight years, but better than nothing. Patch memory was
also increased from 64 to 256 user patches and from 64 to 128
performance patches. An on-board effects processor was added. Four new quick-edit rotary knobs appeared
under the LCD display to tweak certain parameters. This was a great and much needed
feature for performing and just having fun with the Microwave II,
however an external editor would still prove to be the best way to
really dig into editing patches.For 1997, the idea of a synth maker switching to all DSP/digital
circuitry was nothing unusual at all. In fact, it was the norm. DSP
technology offered far more stable and cleaner sounds. But compared with
the original Microwave which used analog VCFs and VCAs, the warmth and
character of the new sound suffered greatly.Despite any sonic drawbacks, the Microwave II was still another
success for Waldorf and led to an even bigger better and truly hands-on
version with the Microwave XT. Microwaves

Wavetable synthesis has been widely used in early digital synths like the SCI ProphetVS, Korg Wavestations and the PPG Wave. At first glance the Wave could intimidate most. However for a digital synth, the Wave has a very clear and intuitive design and layout. This is a digital synth. Samples of waveforms or wavetables are manipulated and combined to create exciting new sounds as well as complex sounds, drones and pads. The filters are analog! There are two, a 24dB low pass and a 12dB high pass. And they've got resonance, distortion and self oscillation. Other unique enhancements to the Wave involve expansion. It comes with 16 voices that can be expanded up to 48 voices. The Wave is also semi-modular with hardware and software expansion options. The Wave is one of Waldorfs' finest synthesizers and probably one of the most advanced wavetable synths ever. A much smaller rack version of the Wave is the Microwave series. The Wave is a professional instrument with a price tag that probably suites it for the most successful of musicians. Most of us interested in the Wave should consider the Microwave series for access to some of the same great sounds and power found in the Wave.

The Chroma was originally an ARP
project. However Rhodes picked it up after ARP dissolved in 1981. Rhodes, best known for its Electric Pianos
released the Chroma (and Chroma Polaris) as their premiere analog synthesizers.
The Chroma had 16 voices with 1 oscillator per voice (or 8 voices with 2 osc/voice), a 64-note velocity sensitive weighted 
keyboard, and a very complicated but powerful synthesis design. Programming was further complexed by a limited implementation
of just 2 rows of membrane push-buttons. With few sliders to grab, hands-on control is cut short. However the
Chroma is a very stable and elegant synth with complete auto-tuning, split-keyboard mode and the ability to link to a computer!Although the Chroma came before there was MIDI, all was not lost. Rhodes
used ARP's proprietary Digital Access Control which was used in some ARP
instruments for inter-connecting them. Midi retro-fits can be purchased
these days which convert MIDI to ARP's DAC system. Perhaps its most
advanced feature for its time was the ability to interface with an Apple
IIe computer for sequence and patch storage using dedicated Chroma
software! That may not be very practical today, but historically it was
a significant example of how synthesizers and personal-computers could
work together. Also on-board you'll find two arpeggiators, a graphic
equalizer, pitch/mod and 6 other sliders. A keyboardless expander module
of the Chroma was also made available. It has been used by Jethro

sweeping through the LFO or analog filter cutoff parameters. It also has
a simple real-time sequencer and 132 memory patches.There's also a nice and colorful layout with sliders similar to Roland
Juno synths, membrane push-buttons and a large velocity sensitive
61-note keyboard making the Chroma Polaris a very nice synth. Fully

sensitive keyboards! Complete synthesis and editing of digitally sampled sounds. 
Three different on-board SMPTE Sequencers and storage to various
disk mediums. The processor itself is housed in a 24"" module.
It was also the first digital sampler to hit the market
back in 1979 and has endured throughout the eighties and nineties.From 1979 to 1985 several versions of the Fairlight were produced, with
the Series III being the last of them. Each new series added updates to
the Fairlight as technology developed through the early eighties. The
Fairlight 1 and 2 had only 16 kByte of Memory per voice, and only eight
voices but expanded to several megabytes and double the polyphony by the
Fairlight III. The IIx was the first Fairlight to offer MIDI. The Series
III added aftertouch capability to the keyboard. They all had pitch/mod
wheels, an 82-key alphanumeric keyboard, 15 function keys, a Graphics
Tablet for drawing sounds and a Video Monitor for seeing what you're
doing while editing.The sampler is the heart of the Fairlight. It's a 16-bit resolution
digital sampler with variable sample-rates up to 100kHz! Original
Fairlight models used two standard 8 bit 6800 processors, updated to the
more powerful 16 bit 68000 chips in later versions (the IIx had updated
6809 processors, which is what designated it a IIx over a II, and raised
the sampling resolution to 32kHz, from the I & II's 24kHz). In the
Fairlight III, sample memory (RAM) comes in 28MB chunks per 16 voices of
polyphony - wow! That's plenty of room for creating stereo or mono
samples. Edit them using various hi-tech functions and at a
'microscopic' level using the large Monitor screen. Samples can be
looped, mixed and re-sampled with processing for sweetening. As for
synthesis, create your own waveforms by sampling and applying Fast
Fourier Transform and Waveform editing functions. Storing samples and
synthesized waveforms can be done to Hard Disk or 8"" floppy disks.As for sequencing, there are three sophisticated methods. There's CAPS 
(Composer, Arranger, Performer Sequencer), an 80-track polyphonic sequencer.
The complicated MCL (Music Composition Language) is like a text-based step time sequencer.
And finally the Rhythm Sequencer which functions like a classic
drum-machine style sequencer. All sequencer's are SMPTE syncable.The Fairlight is a horribly expensive Music Production Center and is rivalled only
by the NED Synclavier. Although current samplers, sequencers and synths can blow
away the Fairlight at a fraction of the cost - the Fairlight is
an historical, prized piece of Vintage Digital Synthesizer and Sampler
technology. It still holds up today, over twenty years later and is
still a high quality and professional instrument. The facilities provided

specifically for the home market. Very basic and easy to use, this is a nice 
cheap way to get your hands on Moog sounds! The MG-1 is a 2-VCO monophonic/polyphonic analog synth with a genuine 24dB/oct Moog 
filter, however the overall sound is thin. On the MG-1, the VCOs are referred to as 
'Tone Generators'. It can produce sawtooth, square and pulse waveforms, and the oscillators
are detunable and syncable. A simple ASR (attack, sustain, release) envelope called 
'Contour' can be applied to both the
amp and the filter. The LFO section provides triangle or square wave patterns as
well as Sample-and-Hold. Additionally there is a simple Ring-Mod effect called 'Bell'.Unique to the MG-1 is a slider on the far right side of the keyboard which 
controls the volume of a simple divide-down polyphonic organ sound. This feature makes it at least a 
little more versatile than the Rogue. There are RCA inputs and outputs
(the input is routed straight to the output for playing along with music from your stereo system)
but no external speakers as in most other home marketed synthesizers. There is also no sign of 
Midi or patch memory on the MG-1. It is used by Peter Gabriel, 808 State, Remy Shand, and KMFDM.Here is a table highlighting some of the differences pointed out by a user between the MG-1 and Rogue.",

modifying, combining, and distributing control signals. Used in connection with
Moogerfooger analog effects modules or other voltage-controlled gear like classic Moog synthesizers,
the CP-251 forms a modular analog synthesizer system, with the same kind of power
and versatility of the classic MOOG modular synthesizers. These Control Signals are the same
type signals used in classic modular analog synths to control them externally (sort of like MIDI).The CP-251 has four Inputs for up to four control voltages (two may be from expressions pedals)
which can be sent to as many as three destinations.
Controls include input attenuators, master gain and offset levels. Both inverting an non-inverting 
outputs. A Lag Processor limits the rate of change per control signal from as fast as one volt 
per millisecond to as slow as one volt per second for shaping some dynamic waveforms!A Voltage-Controlled Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) produces triangular and square
waves over the frequency range 0.2 Hz - 50 Hz for adding modulation to your voltage-controlled 
gear. A Sample and Hold effect can be used to dynamically control waveforms in interesting
and sometimes, unpredictable ways. A funky trick has been built-in which a White Noise 
generator can be used as a control signal (as well as for audio).If you've got Analog gear, the CP-251 can give you a new and unique means of controlling
your gear. Use it to have your ARP control your Moog, for example. Or if you've got Moogerfoogers
you can interconnect them to create wacky new effects out of them! Unfortunately
the CP-251 is not fitted with Memory or MIDI and won't convert Control Voltages to MIDI or vice versa. 
But it gives you a great new means of controlling real synthesizers...and it's created by the master!",

sounds using your hands, arms, elbows or head! The Theremin was designed in the earlier
part of the 20th century by Leon Theremin. It's a simple oscillating circuit that produces
a simple sine wave over a 5-octave pitch range. Two antenna perpendicular to each other (one is loop-shaped)
create your playing field. The vertical one controls pitch and the horizontal volume. 
By moving your hands in the field between these you affect the capacitance within the rods
and thus, the oscillators pitch and volume. This is truly a unique and difficult
but masterable form of sci-fi music performance.The models offered are virtually equal. The Moog Signature Series has Bob Moog's signature
on its front panel, that's it. Both Theremins's are made of solid wood, mic-stand mountable and come with instructional videos
(you may need them)! They are truly analog instruments so you get an authentic and warm sound
with modern quality and specifications. A few knobs on the face plate control waveform, brightness 
and level. Moog Music also offers the standard Etherwave Theremin in a build-it-yourself kit for $299.
Plenty of accessories and options include the instructional video on playing the Theremin,
a photo history booklet by Bob Moog, a ""hot-rodding"" manual for customizing your theremin,
an Etherwave Gig Bag, the Moog TB-15 Theremin Amplifier (15-watt, 8 inch speaker, 3-band EQ, $99)

is most similar to Moog's most popular dual-vco synth, the Prodigy. The actual synth controls of the
Liberation are nearly identical to the Prodigy, with the addition of
Ring Mod, Noise and Polysynth controls in the Mixer section. The
Liberation also uses sliders and toggle switches instead of the

Moog sound. Its two analog oscillators are combined to produce a
monophonic, single-note output. Each oscillator features sawtooth,
triangle and square shapes (waveforms can be selected independently on
each VCO) adjustable over three octave ranges each, and they can be
mixed together to produce a variety of tones. There is also a
simple polyphonic section that can be useful for playing organ-type
sounds. There is the traditional 24 dB/oct Moog filter section with its
own cutoff, resonance (emphasis) and envelope controls (attack,
decay/release, sustain), and a Loudness amp with attack, decay/release,
sustain envelope controls. Some other nice on-board features include a
Ring Modulator, Noise Generator, and syncable VCO's. But one of its
great features is its ribbon controller, located in the hand-grip
portion of the synth which can be used for pitch bending and modulation effects.A rare white painted LiberationIf you're looking to perform with a cheap (by Moog standards) analog

editable presets and a 37-note keyboard. It is a monophonic synth with
two oscillators (the Voyager has three osc). Waveform selector is
continuously variable between waveforms (tri, saw, square, pulse) and
there is oscillator-sync. The filter is the classic Moog ladder design.
Two ADSR envelope generators are available for the volume and the

on-board sequencers or effects, however.The interface couldn't be simpler and despite the minimized number of
buttons and knobs, there are no hidden pages or sub-layers of button
functions - all controls are still very hands-on and provide excellent
visual feedback via two-tone back-lit buttons, dials and pitch bend /
mod wheels. Beautiful, hand-built, simple, effective, powerful - classic
Moog design. The Little Phatty is designed to offer a 21st century
analog Moog synthesizer in a compact portable package and at a price
every musician can afford.The standard edition is the Stage model (pictured top). Moog initially released

sound engine was designed by the late and great Bob Moog himself. It's
the final synth he built for us. And it simply sounds amazing! It's

come from Moog before they eventually went bankrupt and out of
business. As a result, it was never fully completed; as MIDI
technology was just coming out, the Memorymoog never did get to fully
implement MIDI capability. There were two versions of this synth: the
Memorymoog and the Memorymoog Plus (the version can be determined via
the Autotune feature). The Plus model added a basic MIDI implementation,
a Sequencer, and it also had more stable oscillator control, making
the Plus model more valuable to collectors than the standard
model.Due to the seemingly incomplete MIDI implementation as well as a
less than perfect user-interface/operating system, some popular
upgrades and retrofits have been produced and these days it is very
common to find Memorymoogs with these retrofits. The most valuable
upgrade is the Lintronics Advanced Memorymoog (LAMM), originally
designed for the standard model, but also available for the Plus
model. It provides a redesigned operating system, advanced MIDI
functions and improved hardware components. Kenton Electronics
produces MIDI retrofits for both the standard and Plus Memorymoog
models (Kenton and Lintronics can even install these upgrades for you,
considering the delicate nature and value of the Memorymoog). These
upgrades can substantially increase the stability, MIDI functionality
and value of the Memorymoog.The Memorymoog is like having six Minimoogs
stacked in one! Features include VCO syncing, sample and hold, and
separate filters for each voice! It also has a Unison mode for a fat
18 oscillator monophonic bass and lead sound. And as its name would
suggest, it has memory storage - 100 patches! It should also be noted

MuRF is a filter sequencer, capable of creating animated filter effects
across eight frequency bands. These warm and resonant filters can be
applied to any sound source: guitars, synthesizers, vocals, etc. All
processing is 100% analog and its parameters can be controlled from
MIDI, expression pedals or CV-compatible instruments.Third in a series of MuRF pedals, the MF-105M MIDI MuRF combines all of
the features of its two predecessors and takes the idea of the filter
sequencer even further. There were three limitations of the original
MF-105, all of which have finally been addressed by the MF-105M.Firstly, the original MF-105 was better suited to guitar and mid-range
frequencies. The MF-105B follow-up was aimed at those who wanted a more
bass-friendly unit. But with the MF-105M, the user can now switch
between Mids or Bass frequency bands to animate the desired frequencies:BASS - 110 Hz, 160 Hz, 240 Hz, 350 Hz, 525 Hz, 775 Hz, 1.2kHz,
1.8kHz.MIDS - 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 450 Hz, 675 Hz, 1kHz, 1.5 kHz,
2.2 kHz, 3.4kHz.Secondly, the older MF-105s were difficult to sync in a MIDI studio. The
new MIDI In of the MF-105M allows perfect MIDI-clock synchronization
with DAWs, drum machines, and other devices. Continuous Control (CC)
MIDI data allows the user to start, re-start, and stop the pattern as
well.Thirdly, the patterns on the older units were fun but not editable. With
the MF-105M, the user can create original patterns. Moog shipped a free
Mac/PC sequence editor that allows the user to easily draw custom
patterns and transfer them to the MIDI MuRF. All of the front panel
controls can also be controlled from the software editor as well.Like all Moogerfoogers, the MF-105M is designed to be anything from a
foot pedal effect unit to part of a modular synthesis system. With its
tap/step and rate jacks, even those who stay clear of MIDI (or
synthesizers) will find the MIDI MuRF is a great tool for animating
their sounds in creative new ways. In fact, a Moog expression pedal or
MP-201 is great for getting more expressiveness out of the unit. Whether
it's morphing drones, stuttering lead lines, filtering drum patterns, or
space age sequences, the Moog MIDI MuRF delivers the goods.",

stand-alone filter processor since it has a filter that is virtually
identical to the one found in the Minimoog, and it accepts external sounds for processing
through itself (all at a fraction of the price for a Mini)! It also employs
a ribbon controller (which was a cool new feature) for pitch bending.

for musicians! Compact, affordable, simplified and based on the
megalithic modular Moog synths, the Minimoog
became the most popular synth of all time, and still is to this day!
Prior to the Minimoog, synthesizers were custom built to order, and
required a great deal of technical knowledge to be able to wire up and
create a sound. The Minimoog changed all that by hard-wiring the most
basic but essential of components into a compact keyboard any musician
could not only play, but dial up some great sounds on! Thus, the
Minimoog was the first synthesizer to show up on the shelves of music
stores around the world.Though its design impacted the industry in a way that set the stage
for all the synthesizers that came after it, the Minimoog is probably
most famous for its excellent analog sound and arguably the best filters
in a portable synth. It featured three oscillators (one of which can be
used as an LFO) that could be individually tuned and offered multiple
waveforms. The Minimoog is monophonic (only one note can be played at a
time) so the three oscillators allow for an incredibly rich sound -
three de-tuned oscillators each playing a different waveform can create
some pretty thick analog sounds! There are also some
very cool modulation possibilities when using one of the oscillators as
an LFO.But you can't talk about the Minimoog without mentioning its
filters. The Minimoog uses a 4-pole (24 dB/oct) low-pass filter with cutoff,
resonance, ADS envelope, and keyboard tracking controls. Amazingly, Dr.
Moog's filter design has yet to be surpassed by a better sounding
filter. It's a filter that sounds so warm and smooth that Moog's
rival, ARP, tried to copy it for their 2600
and Odyssey synths.The Minimoog's internal wiring configuration and front panel layout
has defined the general synthesizer configuration for decades. Every
adjustable parameter is so clearly laid out on the front panel that the
Minimoog makes a great teaching tool for anyone interested in classic
subtractive synthesis. It even has a built-in A-440 tone generator so
you can manually tune the oscillators-which is nice since (like mosts
analog synths that heat up) the tuning of even this machine can be a
little bit unstable. Though input jacks allow you to run your own external audio
through the Minimoog's filters, modulation and amplifier circuits
too!The Minimoog is responsible for some of the warmest and best analog
synth bass, lead and whistle sounds ever. Its control panel can lay flat
or propped up perpendicular to the keyboard. It also has a great wood
casing. Very rugged. A very versatile synth, useful in all styles of
music and easy enough for anybody to operate! It is used by The
Chemical Brothers, The Orb, Kraftwerk, Jan Hammer, Nine Inch Nails,
Vince Clarke, Gary Numan, Add N To (X), Rick Wakeman, 808 State, Air,

Herbie Hancock.Evolution of the Minimoog: (pictured above from The Audities Foundation).Model-A Prototype - Built in 1969. This version more closely
resembles the modular Moog's but in a very compact form. In its
wood case, six Moog designed modules were internally hard-wired together
and connected to a small keyboard. Many labels were typed out on paper and taped on to
the front panel above the knobs.Model-B Prototype - Built in 1970. In this version, the modular
look was eliminated as the components were brought together by a
pupose built front panel lay out. The three identical VCO sections were stacked
on top of each other on the left. The right side held the Amplitude and
Filter contour controls. The middle section held the Noise, Filter (cutoff, res) and master tuning
controls. There was even a power switch on the front.Model-C Prototype - Built in 1970. This version really begins to 
look like a Minimoog. The familiar left-to-right layout of
Controllers, Oscillator Bank, Mixer, Modifiers and Output sections
and the signature pop-up front panel had come to exist. The Model-C was
photographed for the original Sales Flyer introducing the Minimoog,
although in that flyer it was referred to as the Model-D.Model-D Prototype - Built in 1970 almost immediately after the Model-C. A few more 
cosmetic tweaks to the front panel design brought about the last few
final touches before readying for commercial production of the official Model-D.Model-D - Built in 1971.
A few more design tweaks (like adding some red rocker-switches
and proper pitch-bend and mod wheels) and the Model-D was the Minimoog
sold to the public. Interestingly, there are three versions of the Model-D, with some very
minor and mainly cosmetic variations to each. Fortunately they can
be distinguished from their name-plates.The very first batch of Minimoogs made in 1971 (a few dozen) were labelled 'R.A. Moog'
(as in, Robert Arthur Moog). Then there was a very short
period during 1972 in which Moog Music, which had just merged with the smaller
muSonics company, saw the production of a scant handful of ""Moog
muSonics"" Minimoogs. Then from 1972-1981 came the Moog Music, Inc. labelled Minimoogs which make up the majority
of Minis that are out there. While there seems to be no
difference sonically between the Moog muSonics and Moog Music versions, the original
R.A. Moog Minis do have a slightly different--to some ears--warmer
sound.The Model-D Minimoog has been (unoficially) reissued several times during the
late 1990's by businesses that often failed, quite rapidly. Finally, it
was successfully and faithfully reproduced by Moog Synthesizers in the
UK, with MIDI and other updated features. But it wasn't until 2002 that the first official
new Minimoog designed by Dr. Robert Moog himself was released by Moog Music (once Big
Briar) in the form of the ultimate Minimoog - the Minimoog Voyager.Hardware/Software Alternatives:Studio Electronics Midimoog - An analog recreation of the original Minimoog with an authentic Minimoog Model-D board inside a rack-mount design, with MIDI and a dedicated LFO.Studio Electronics SE-1 - A more advanced and flexible rack-mount synth but like the Midimoog, it has an authentic Model-D board inside too.Steinberg's Model-E is an amazing VST Plug-In that is modeled after the Model-D Minimoog.Arturia's Minimoog V - THE most

This
masterpiece of a synthesizer marks two landmarks in the history of
synthesizers: the rebirth of the Minimoog and
the return of Moog
Music! Dr. Robert Moog himself helped design this modern-day
Minimoog along with Big Briar. Big Briar (formed by Dr. Moog in 1978)
became popular in the nineties with their Moogerfooger analog effect
boxes and Etherwave Theremins. In
2002, Moog got the rights back to Moog Music so Big Briar (and all its products) are
now Moog Music.Moog Music introduced the Minimoog Voyager synthesizer in two
editions: the Signature Edition and the Performer
Edition. There were only 600 Signature Edition models and they listed for
$3,495 each! Their unique features include: Hand-finished wood cabinet in
your choice of genuine solid maple (light), cherry (honey-colored), or
walnut (brown), illuminated, clear acrylic Pitch Bend and Modulation
wheels, gold-plated nameplate, padded Gig Bag, 4-year warranty with two
free factory tunings, and is individually inspected and signed by Bob
Moog. The Performer Edition listed for $2,995 and has a solid hardwood
cabinet.The Minimoog Voyager is a true analog monophonic synthesizer (probably
the most expensive one of its kind) and is based entirely on the
original classic Minimoog Model D, which was
produced by Moog Music, Inc. from 1970 to 1982. It introduces many new
features, including a three dimensional touch pad, MIDI I/O, extensive
patching facilities, patch storage, and more! It's cased in a beautiful,
solid hardwood cabinet with a multi-position hinged control panel.Just like the original, the Voyager has three analog wide-range voltage
controlled oscillators, one noise source, as well as one audio
preamplifier for externally-applied audio signals. Two resonant
Moog-style filters are on-board and function in dual lowpass or
lowpass/highpass modes and can be modulated by one of the two ADSR
envelopes, the LFO, or external control. All knobs and switches can have
their settings stored into one of 128 Program memories. Program Banks as
well as the Voyager's Operating System can be uploaded/downloaded via
MIDI SysEx. Centered on its front panel is the ominous, black 3-D (XYZ)
Touch Surface which provides three continuously-variable control signals
which are derived from the up-down and left-right position of the
player's finger, and the amount of area with which the player makes
contact to the surface.There's also a 44-note keyboard, this time with velocity and aftertouch
sensitivity. Also on-board are Pitch and Mod wheels, Glide/Portamento,
and a series of 1/4"" CV and/or Pedal jacks lining the top/rear of the
front panel. The Mod Wheel can be sent to control all oscillators, or
just VCO2, VCO3, the filter cutoff, or LFO rate. The Mod can gets its
source from the LFO (triangle/square/sample-n-hold waveforms), VCO3, or
the external Mod2 input. A Mixer Module gives you a five-input mixer for
combining various audio sources prior to filtering between the
oscillators, noise and external audio input signals.The new Minimoog Voyager is a first class synth; every bit as elegant in
look as sound and quality. It is highly streamlined and offers all the
functionality of a modern day (mono)synth with the classic, warm,
unforgettable Moog sound. It WILL replace your original Minimoog (if
you're lucky enough to have one). Signature models will become prized
possessions for decades to come, and the Performer models will prove to
be major players in future of music to come!! It's being used by
Stevie Wonder, Maroon 5, the Crystal Method, Electric Skychurch,
Duran Duran, Air, Morcheeba, Black Eyed peas, Nine Inch Nails, Blues
Traveller, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dido, The Cure, Herbie Hancock, Rick
Wakeman, Yes, Nickelback, Dream Theater, Paul Simon, Joy Electric, the
Neptunes, Alicia Keys, CeeLo Green, Madonna, Incubus, FUN, Radiohead, Bjork and more!Minimoog Voyager Rack Mount EditionMinimoog Voyager Rack Mount Edition (2005) packages the
Voyager into a 19"" 5U rack mount / table-top version. The Voyager RME
contains all the synthesis functions of the original
Voyager and includes the Electric Blue backlit panel introduced with
the Anniversary Edition Voyager from 2004. New features include a switchable
output mode (balanced/unbalanced) and an Input Accessory Port for
CV/Gate Inputs. Up to 16 RME Voyagers can be linked together to achieve
polyphony. The RME listed for $2,795.Minimoog Voyager Electric BlueMinimoog Voyager Electric Blue (2006) is based off the limited run
of the 50th Anniversary Edition Voyagers from 2004-05, which featured a black
painted wood cabinet and the control panel was backlit using electroluminescent
technology. The Electric Blue models which have been sold since 2006 continue
to feature the electric blue backlit panel and is housed in a fractal blue solid 
ash cabinet and lists for $3,556.Minimoog Voyager Select SeriesMinimoog Voyager Select Series (2006-13) was a customizable
version of the Electric Blue in which the customer can
choose between mahogany, electric blue, traditional ash, white wash,
maple, black, cherry, and walnut cabinets with red, blue, white, orange,
green, or purple backlighting. They listed for $3,659 but were reduced to $2,999
when discontinued in 2013.Minimoog Voyager Old SchoolMinimoog Voyager Old School (2008-09) looks like a traditional
1970's Minimoog. The Old School is focused on traditional features,
dropping digital controls and leaving behind a pure analog
sound engine. The central touch pad controller and LCD
screens are gone. It has expanded modulation capabilities beyond that of the previous
Voyagers (more patchable sources and destinations). MIDI I/O is absent,
but it has pitch CV out and keyboard gate CV out. It was only available
in the ""Traditional Ash"" wood panelling and listed at $2,695. Billed by Moog as the perfect 
replacement for the Minimoog Model D. The Old School was discontinued in 2009.Minimoog Voyager XLMinimoog Voyager XL (2010) was released in celebration of the
40th anniversary of the Minimoog Model D. It adds to the Voyager an
expanded 61-note keyboard, a ribbon controller, an additional
LFO/modulation bus, and most notably, an extensive front-panel analog
patch bay that opens the Voyager up to a more modular approach to
creating sounds with more flexibility than any previous Voyager model.

By preset sounds we mean sounds
like Trumpet, Oboe, Clarinet, Sax, Taurus, Violin, Piano, Guitar I,
Guitar II, Aries, Lunar, and Flute. It's a smallish keyboard with a 37
note keyboard. The sounds can be transposed down over 3 octaves for a
wide pitch range. The pre-programmed sounds are switched via those
clunky large flip-switches below the keyboard, apparently their location
makes switching patches while playing more accessible. The Taurus, Lunar
and Aries are interesting ""new"" sounds that were preprogrammed into the
Minitmoog.The group of fader type sliders for your left hand to tweak while
performing offer nice hands-on tweaking useful for even todays
performance situations. They offer controls for the filter, modulation
and glide effects. The synth architecture has two VCO's that work
together to produce a monophonic tone. However they can be tuned far
apart or synced together for that fairly fat dual-vco sound! The
Sync-Sweep effect really adds some motion to the sounds from the
oscillators.Aftertouch was employed on the Minitmoog. Sweep through the filter, sync
sweep, bend the pitch or modulate the sound with pressure sensitive keys
that produce more effect the harder you press! In some respects it was
ahead of its time. However the lack of programmability and memory
storage leave much to be desired with the Minitmoog.",

to create a large ensemble system called the Constellation. It was to
include two keyboard synthesizers, the polyphonic Apollo and monophonic
Lyra, and the Taurus foot pedalboard synthesizer. Although the
Constellation project never made it to production, the Taurus pedalboard
was released on its own, while the ""Apollo Polyphonic Synthesizer"" went
on to become the Polymoog. It is also noteworthy that the
Apollo/Polymoog project did not directly involve Bob Moog and was
instead mostly designed by Dave Luce at Moog Music.The Polymoog (model 203a) is a fully polyphonic preset-based
synthesizer released in 1975. Its eight preset sounds consist of
Strings, Piano, Organ, Harpsichord, Funk, Clavi, Vibes and Brass. There
is also a Var (Variation) mode that allows any one of the preset sounds
to be fully modified into unique and wild analog sounds using all of the
available synthesis parameters on board. There’s a genuine Moog ladder
filter inside with modulation, keyboard tracking and lots of LFO
modulation sources. The Polymoog features a full 71-key, velocity
sensitive Pratt & Read weighted keyboard that can be split into
three sections, each with independent volume sliders. There is a 3-band
EQ, sample-and-hold, pitch controller ribbon and a full set of envelope
controls. What you won’t find, however, is patch memory or MIDI
control.Polymoog Keyboard 280aThe Polymoog 203a was originally known as the Polymoog Keyboard. In
1978, a newer, cheaper and more simplified model was released, the
Polymoog Keyboard 280a. The original model 203a was thus re-named the
Polymoog Synthesizer. The 280a model has more preset sounds (fourteen of
them) but eliminated most of the editing functions that make the
original 203a so much more flexible. The 280a model’s new preset sounds
included Vox Humana, Strings 2, Electric and Honky Tonk pianos, Chorus
Brass and a Rock Organ. Because programming is so limited you’re pretty
much stuck with the presets. Fortunately the Vox Humana preset is a
wonderful sound (used famously by Gary Numan). Editing is reduced to
volume, tuning, hi-pass filtering, and basic LFO features. The 280a
model can easily be identified by the name ‘Polymoog Keyboard’ printed
where sliders and knobs would exist on the 203a model.Polypedal Controller 285aAn optional Polypedal board (model 285a) allows for external
control of the pitch, filter, and volume via two large black foot pedals. Sustain and trigger mode can
be controlled by two smaller silver foot pedals, and external sync of the
Polymoog can also be controlled.It should be noted that the Polymoogs are not
true poly synths in the traditional sense. They use a ‘divide-down’ circuitry
arrangement similar to certain string synths, combo organs, etc. This allows
them to be fully polyphonic across the entire range of the 71-note keyboard. Sadly, the
Polymoog is rather unreliable and prone to breakdown; used specimens are
often problematic when left unserviced. Unfortunately,
their complexity makes them difficult to service and even more
difficult to find a qualified technician. By the way, the large amount
of real-estate on the top of the Polymoog was designed that way as a place
to put your Minimoog (or other synthesizers) on top of it. Don’t worry,
it can take the weight, as the Polymoog itself weighs a whopping 82
pounds!Unique among Moog’s lineup, the Polymoog is not at all like the
Minimoog or any of the other mono-synths Moog has become famous for.
Instead, it was designed to complement Moog’s monophonic synthesizers.
It’s a unique and finicky product, the brain child
of David Luce instead of Dr. Bob Moog himself. But like all Moog
products, this isn’t an ordinary instrument — it’s the Polymoog and it sounds
fantastic for what it is. Polymoog’s have been used by Chick Corea,
Blondie, Keith Emerson, Devo, Gary Numan, Prince, Herbie Hancock,
Richard Tandy of ELO, Patrick Moraz, Rush, Larry Fast, Wendy Carlos,
Tony Banks, Kraftwerk, Geoff Downes, Jimmy Edgar, Freddy Fresh, and Rick

two-oscillator analog monosynth from Moog that, while having genuine

make this Moog's most compact and inexpensive offering of its time. In
fact, the design was so simplified and streamlined that Moog licensed
the design to Tandy/Radioshack who built the nearly identical Realistic Concertmate MG-1, which actually offers more features for less bucks!
Incidentally the Rogue is also utilized as the Moog Taurus II Bass Synth with
1-1/2 octave bass pedals instead of the Rogue's 2-1/2 octave keyboard.The Rogue could be considered a very scaled down version of the Prodigy
(which was itself a very scaled down Minimoog) offering far fewer
synthesis options and flexibility. Only two waveforms per oscillator
(saw and square/rectangle) and, unlike the Prodigy, the oscillators must
play the exact same waveform and pitch range, for a much more limited
sonic range of synth tones. You cannot mix Sawtooth with
Square/Rectangle waves on the Rogue, whereas you can on the Prodigy and
Liberation. Another cutback is the single envelope generator that is
shared by both the Filter and the Loudness Amp, offering just Attack,
Release and a switchable Sustain mode (OFF, HALF, FULL).
Still, the Rogue has a decent Moog filter with an external audio input.Moog was definitely cutting costs with this model, making it the
smallest, simplest and most basic synth in their line-up; yet still
versatile and user-friendly enough to be used as the Taurus II Bass

the Slim Phatty was a bit of a disappointment. But for those who had
enough keyboards cluttering the studio and just wanted that big juicy
Moog sound, it was most welcome.The Slim Phatty has the same engine as the much-loved
Little Phatty but in a rack-mountable
unit (3U) that can also be used as a tabletop unit, made
oh-so-retro-chic with the optional wooden end caps. The Little and Slim
Phatty share the same firmware so any updates can be made to either one.
The Slim Phatty was the first Moog device with USB, which not only makes
those updates easier but also makes integration into a modern studio
very simple. For those who have dreamed of owning a polyphonic Moog but
can't afford a Memorymoog, the Slim Phatty
can also be chained with other Phatty devices for multi-voiced Moog
richness.Moog left off the Little Phatty's rather heavy case, the 37-key
keyboard, and the mod and pitch wheels, so what remains is a lightweight
and even portable version of the Little Phatty's main engine, fully
compatible with MIDI, DAW, or CV-based studios. The control panel is a
bit smaller than the Little Phatty's but still very comfortable and easy
to use. Not quite knob-per-function, but nevertheless very
straightforward.As for the sound, it's exactly the big, thick oscillators and the rich
wet filter that players expect from a Moog. Modulation is limited,
especially compared to more modern mono-synths, but it was made to be
compatible with the Moogerfooger line, the MP-201 and the
CP-251 for semi-modular flexibility. Later
firmware updates added velocity sensitivity for volume, alternative
scales, LFO reset, and other features, making the Slim Phatty a perfect
choice for players who want the all-analog Moog sound with the
flexibility of modern synths.In 2013 the Slim Phatty, which had a black faceplate to match the Little
Phatty, received an aesthetic makeover to match it to the new
metallic-white Sub Phatty.",

from the Moog history books. Its predecessor, the Sonic V, was designed
by an ex-Moog employee for the muSonics brand. When muSonics eventually
bought out R.A. Moog, forming Moog muSonics, the Sonic V’s basic design
was moved into a portable brief-case style synthesizer, and with only a few tweaks, the Sonic
Six was born.The fact that the Sonic Six originated from another company’s design 
not only accounts for why the Sonic Six looks different than any other Moog,
but also for some pretty unique differences under the hood as well. To start,
it is duo-phonic, utilizing two analog oscillators with three basic waveforms each
plus tuning, modulation and scaling controls. There are two independent LFO 
generators with advanced control options not seen on other Moog synths
(for instance, an X/Y knob is used to mix and balance the LFO outputs).
Also on-board is a Ring Modulator (that can modulate either Osc. B or external audio)
and pink/white noise generators.Moog synthesizers are known for their filters, and the Sonic Six
strays from the usual Moog in this area as well. While it is known that
ARP stole a filter design from Moog for use in some of their
2600 and Odyssey models, leading to lawsuits between Moog and ARP,
according to Mark Vail in ""Vintage Synthesizers,"" the Sonic Six actually
used some circuitry in its filters which were stolen from an ARP design,
although ARP never sued Moog over it. However, later models of the Sonic
Six were eventually fitted with a more traditional Moog designed filter. In either case, the filter
is a low-pass 24dB/oct which offers the usual controls and is capable of
self-oscillation. The VCA, however, has a rather limited set of controls
- attack and decay plus a sustain on/off switch.Not commonly seen, they are actually rather durable devices and used
ones generally (if proper care was taken of them) are found in good
working order. It was originally designed for educational and home use
so it is light and portable and even has a built-in amplifier and
speaker. It’s a genuine Moog synth that is equally as obscure as useful
these days. And its rather simple looking front-panel layout hides the
uniquely flexible, powerful and great sounding little beast it truly is! It
has been used by Freddy Fresh, Stereolab and Spectrum/EAR.",

implemented to transfer your patches to and from an external tape and
free up the on-board memory for additional new patches. But in an effort
to modernize with the eighties, the Moog had replaced all buttons, knobs
and sliders with flat-panel membrane buttons and a single data-wheel
assignment format. At the time, this may have seemed far-out, but
in all actuality it is the Source's downfall.Parameters are edited not with hands-on sliders and knobs but by
assigning a selected parameter to the dedicated data wheel. This is very
tedious and does not allow for true hands-on tweaking during
performances nor can you adjust different parameters simultaneously or
while playing. These days, the membrane buttons don't always seem to
work quite right either. However, those famous monophonic Moog sounds

likely find a picture of a Moog modular system. Robert Moog is considered the
father of analog synthesizers — not because he was the first to build such instruments,
but because his brilliant circuit designs sounded amazing and thus, became the most popular
among serious musicians looking to forge new ground in music. The first Moog modular prototype
was built in in 1964, with orders for custom systems being taken as early as 1965, and a 
commercially available product line by 1967. Moog Music continued to build and sell these analog
music machines to universities, studios and musicians throughout the sixties and seventies.
Eventually, the technology in these systems was transferred into more compact,
portable and affordable synthesizers like the Minimoog,
ultimately giving rise to the modern synthesizer.As imposing as these systems may look, they are merely solid walnut cabinets housing
smaller dedicated function “modules” which, when interconnected by patch cables, can be used
to create, shape and manipulate electronic sounds into musical bliss. This modular
approach allowed buyers to configure the systems to meet their needs or their budgets.
In addition to custom configurations, Moog Music also offered pre-configured systems in a variety of models:The Moog modular synthesizers use the 900-series of modules.
These modules, many of them designed entirely by Robert Moog, are examples of analog synthesis at its finest. 
The modules are actually quite musician-friendly with straight forward
input and output jacks and clearly labeled knobs. There
are no technical electronic diagrams silk-screened all over them or esoteric controls.
They were very easy to grasp conceptually, making them perfect candidates
for music labs and professional musicians alike.The voltage-controlled oscillator modules produce
stunning tones with only one real drawback...drift. Revised VCO
modules (the 921-series) were eventually released that offered more stable tuning. But the legend of the Moog sound
truly comes from the 24 dB/oct lowpass filter (the 904A). To this day, no one has come close to improving upon
the original Moog filter and its patented ladder design. Additional modules include VCAs, envelope generators,
highpass filters, equalizers, noise generators, a sequencer, and utilitarian modules
such as audio mixers, control voltage processors and power supplies. There is no dedicated LFO module, however. Instead,
one of the VCO modules has a rate slow enough (0.1 Hz) that it can be used as an LFO instead of a sound source.Even the smallest and most compact of the synthesizer systems offered had
everything needed for a complete and flexible synthesizer. All systems came with
at least three oscillators, while the larger 3p and 55 models had as many as ten 
oscillators! All systems also featured a remote keyboard controller.
Typically 49-note keyboards were used although a 61-note keyboard was used on the larger models.
Dynamic controllers were also available, including a nearly full keyboard-length ribbon controller,
X-Y joystick controller and foot pedal keyboard. Pitch and Mod wheels may not
have been invented yet, but even these early synthesizers had plenty of expressive performance
controls. Ribbon controllers and X-Y joystick controllers would continue to be utilized
for various control purposes in the decades following the Moog synthesizers.One common problem with these synths is their incompatibility with the
Gate/Trigger systems used in most other synths. Moog equipment, for the most
part, used a ‘high-state’ logic called ‘S-trig’ which maintained a +5V
until a trigger was sent, and this was done by dropping the voltage to
0. This is the opposite of what’s commonly used in other synths of the
time. It also can lead to a problem if a patch used an extensive amount
of triggering connections, as each module would cause a voltage
drop...and enough of them would send the logic over into low-state and
fire the S-trigger. This problem is little-known, and can lead to a
good bit of frustration for users who have never worked with Moog products before.When they were new, Moog modular synthesizers were very expensive. They originally sold
between $2,000 and $10,000 for complete systems; individual modules varied from $100 to $1,300 each. They can be even more expensive 
today on the second-hand market. They are, after all, rare and irreplaceable legacies of synthesizer history. 
Fortunately, it is possible to experiment with them via Arturia's Moog Modular V - an amazing
software synth plug-in modeled after the modular Moog synths,
with modernizations such as stereo and polyphonic voices,
non-drifting oscillators,  advanced modulation abilities, MIDI/Tempo
sync, patch memory, total recall, controller automation, and much more — all
for less than $350! It is not the same as the real thing, but
it is still a fun way to start patching and routing some sounds, experimenting and seeing what might happen,
and getting a taste of the experience of working with a modular Moog.Moog’s modular synthesizers have
been used by Keith Emerson, Hans Zimmer, Mark Isham, Vangelis, John Cage, Vince Clarke, 
Klaus Schulze, Stevie Wonder, Tangerine Dream, Depeche Mode and 
famously by Walter/Wendy Carlos on the album “Switched on Bach” which 
was a ground-breaking classical album performed entirely with Moog modular synthesizers in 1968.",

Synthesizer - a monophonic analog bass synthesizer you play with your
feet (so you can play other instruments with your hands). Originally,
the Taurus was going to be part of a larger ensemble system called the
Constellation. It was to include two keyboard synthesizers, the Apollo (polyphonic) and the Lyra (monophonic),
and the Taurus foot pedalboard synthesizer. The Constellation project never made it
to production, but the Taurus was released on its own, while the Apollo
keyboard went on to evolve in to the Polymoog.The Taurus has three Preset sounds and one User programmable. The three preset
sounds are Bass, Tuba and Taurus. Most users prefer the Variable preset
which lets them synthesize their own sounds using the simple VCO, VCF and VCA
controls. The shaping controls are hidden behind a 
plastic window to prevent accidental foot tweaking.The Taurus is monophonic, with sound generation coming from a simple 
two-oscillator design that can be tuned across a 5-octave range. An Octave button lets you shift the pedal keyboard up or
down an octave, the direction must be set using the Octave switch in the Variables section.
There's also a Glide (portamento) effect and a Decay effect. The amount of Glide and Decay are
also set in the Variables section. Like any Moog, there is a 24 dB/oct lowpass filter with 
controls for Emphasis, Contour Amount/Attack/Decay and Cut-Off. Two
gigantic foot-sliders flank the sides of the Taurus and they are used to
adjust the Filter cut-off and VCA Loudness on the fly using your feet.

square waveforms. But these waveforms go low and their bass sounds are
great. The pedal controller outputs cv/gate so it can be used to control
other synths as well. The synth section has an external source input for
the filter, and there are portamento, pitch and mod wheels too! Not at
all a bad synth, and it is a very unique addition to any studio. But can
you play with your feet?",

and architecture is almost identical to the Bode 7702 vocoder.
It's a 16-band analog vocoder which separates a given synthesizer sound 
(carrier signal) into seperate frequncy bands ranging from 50 to 5080 cycles
per second. It does not have any internal oscillators so it is designed
to be used as a processor for external carrier and modulator wave sources.
The modulator is typically a vocal or drum beat used to modulate the carrier/synth sound being processed.It has microphone and line inputs as well as 16 synthesizer inputs (1 for
each frequency band) and 16 outputs. This 16 channel cross-matrix
patching system is cumbersome, but useful during the modular synth era,
allowing for full external patching between synth and vocoder sections.
Other features include a high-frequency bypass, a short 6ms response
time for capturing fast percussive sounds, sample-and-hold, and a global
bypass switch to turn off the vocoding effect. Unfortunately there is no
output mixer, MIDI or CV/Gate. It has been used by Saga, Yellow Magic

makers at Siel to the Italian and European markets. However, it made its
way to the USA’s shores when Sequential Circuits, who really wanted to
add a compact mono+poly synth to their own product line but lacked the
resources to do it on their own, worked with Siel to release
their own re-branded and re-painted version of the Cruise
known as the Sequential Fugue. In true
Italian style, the only difference between the two, was that the Cruise
looked good!The Cruise is two synths in one, combining what is Siel’s Orchestra and Mono synthesizer models into one powerful
synthesizer! It features two discrete synthesizer modes or sections:
Mono Synthesizer and Poly Synthesizer. The front panel has a lot of graphical
information printed on it to clearly designate the Mono section
functions from the Poly section features, as well as signal flow charts
to help the user understand how the sounds are internally routed. In the
middle of the synth is the ‘Masters’ section. This holds master volume
sliders for the Mono and Poly synth sections and keyboard split mode
options. The keyboard can be split in the middle, and either section of
the Crise can be assigned to either split. When not split, the Mono and
Poly sounds are played at the same time (assuming both sections are
turned on—there are enable buttons for each section), except the
Poly sounds are polyphonic while the Mono sounds will follow the
low-note or high-note priority setting. There are also separate outputs
for the Mono and Poly sections too.The Mono section is a monophonic synthesizer driven by one digitally
controlled oscillator (DCO). There are two synthesis modes for the Mono
section: Preset or Free. In Preset mode, you can select from Bass Tuba,
Trombone, Trumpet, Flute, Picolo, Sax, Clarinet, Violin, Bass and
Guitar. In Free mode you have basic waveforms to choose from including
sawtooth or square waves in various octave ranges. Sound shaping
controls include ADSR envelope, VCF cutoff and resonance, and Vibrato
depth and speed. The Pitch-Bend and Portamento controls left of the
keyboard are only for the Mono synth section. The Mono section is great
for creating bass and lead synth lines.The Poly section is a fully polyphonic string machine, accomplished
using the typical octave divide-down technology used in other
string/orchestra machines. There are four basic sound sections: Brass,
Strings, Piano and Accordion/Organ. The Brass section has Trumpet and
Trombone presets with independent attack (‘Crescendo’) and filter
(‘Resonance’) controls. The String section has Cello and Violin
presets with an attack slider labeled ‘Percuss’. The Accordion/Organ
section has Accordion, Organ and Celeste presets. The Piano section has
three presets including a Honky Tonk piano. A nice touch is the sound
Preset selectors are colored green, while the modifiers are colored red.
With all the sounds from these four Preset sections, you wind up with a
total of 10 preset sounds, which can be combined freely. The only
drawback is they can not be mixed separately—they are either on or
off. Additional features of the Poly section include the Poly Controls:
Brass Attack, Brass Cutoff, Strings Reed Attack and Strings Piano
Decay—these are all very basic envelope and/or filter modifiers
for a couple of the sounds. There is also the ‘Animator’ effect which
is kind of a chorus-tremolo-LFO effect. Naturally, the Poly section is
best at creating classic 70’s String Machine sounds.The Siel Cruise is a really interesting instrument. It helped Siel
branch out of the Organ building business and into synthesizers. Besides
the Sequential Fugue version, the Cruise’s two sections were also
available as separate synthesizers from Siel—the Orchestra
and the Mono. The Cruise’s Poly
section, the Orchestra, was also released in the USA by ARP as the Quartet. So there is
plenty of this synth to go around under various names and forms out
there. It is quite capable of some really nice Mellotron-like strings, a
fair good piano, though the single-oscillator driven Mono synth is a bit
slim due to being a single oscillator, but still quite capable of decent
bass and lead sounds.",

a 6 voice synthesizer with straight forward programming, simple effects
and digitally controlled analog oscillators (DCO's). However, the Siel,
having dual oscillators per voice sounds thicker than the Juno or Matrix
because it's got 12 oscillators! And because they're DCO's, you know
they'll always remain stable and in-tune even though they are analog in
nature.The DK600 has many other nice features such as complete MIDI
implementation. There are 3 LFO's for extreme modulation. Both the
filter and amplifier have standard ADSR envelope sections. And like
similar synths, all the sliders and buttons are intuitively placed on
the front panel for hands-on real-time programming.EK-600 ExpanderThe EX600 Expander module was also released (pictured above), featuring
the same great internal synth engine as the DK600. However, the
Expander is not programmable except from a DK600, an external MIDI
sequencer or editor such as Unisyn. The Expander was intended to be
programmed by transferring patches from the keyboard version. It's not
rack-mountable either so it's usually best to go for the keyboard
version. After all, the keyboard features the great layout of controls,
velocity sensitivity and 61 notes (5 octaves)!",

synthesizer company. It is both a Preset-style synth as well as a single
oscillator subtractive synth. Although it may seem inconspicuous, it is
surprisingly flexible, easy to use and really sounds quite good.There’s just a simple row of sliders for adjusting all of its
parameters. However, the panel layout of all the controls is a bit
unconventional compared to traditional synthesizer signal flow (it
starts with the ADSR and ends with the oscillators). Also, most of the
controls are split up, with some of the filter, envelope and LFO controls on
the left side of the panel, and additional controls for these sections
in the middle of the panel (perhaps Siel thought the controls a
player would want to tweak during a performance should be where the left
hand could easily find them). And then there is the signal-flow diagram
printed along the top of the front panel which is in a more typical
layout and results in the unfortunate caveat that the control sections
do not line up with their equivalent representations in the signal flow
diagram directly above them. But that should not really matter to any
experienced synthesist.  Moving from left to right, the Mono starts with the envelope ADSR
sliders which can be assigned to either the (VCA) amplifier, the (VCF)
filter, or both the VCA and VCF at the same time (although the
assignment switch for the ADSR is located in the middle of the synth
rather than next to the actual ADSR controls). Next comes the VCF (filter)
with only Cutoff and Resonance sliders. The filter can be switched
between Lowpass, Bandpass and Highpass modes (this switch is located in
the middle section of the keyboard). Next up is the LFO section which
only offers one sinusoidal wave-shape with Depth and Rate sliders. Yet
again, the remaining controls for LFO on/off, Delay amount, and
destination (the DCO or the VCF) are located in the middle area of the
panel. Next up is a Noise generator Mix slider (and you guessed it, the
on/off switch is located elsewhere, in the middle bank of sliders), and
an ""Animator"" Depth slider.Next we get to the middle section of the front panel which has sliders
for overall volume output and all the supplementary ADSR, VCF, LFO and
Noise generator controls previously mentioned. There is also an enable switch for the
""Animator"" effect which is sort of like a vibrato.Finally we make it to the oscillator or sound bank section. There are
two operating modes for the Mono: Preset or Free. In Preset mode, you
can select from Bass Tuba, Trombone, Trumpet, Flute, Picolo, Sax,
Clarinet, Violin, Bass and Guitar. Not all editable parameters
may be available for some sounds, so when a Preset is selected, an LED
is illuminated over each section that can be edited. In Free mode 
you have basic waveforms to choose from including sawtooth or square waves.
Of course, there is no user memory available so any custom sounds
or manipulated Preset sounds can not be stored.The remaining controls are located next to the 37-note keyboard: a
joystick-like Pitch-bender and Portamento (over one octave) controls.
The Mono is pre-MIDI, and unfortunately it also lacks any sort of
CV/gate type interfaces as well, so you won’t be able to use it with any
sort of sequencers - hardware or software, analog or MIDI-CV devices.
There are no MIDI retrofit kits either. Ultimately the Mono sounds great and has an uniquely warm, Italian
flavor. Yes, its controls are easy enough to edit and understand. But
the unusual (dis)organization of the parameter sliders does take a little
getting used to, and the lack of any sort of external control options is
unfortunate. Still, it makes an inexpensive and very unique alternative
to the more common mono-synths from Moog, Roland, ARP and Korg.",

synthesizer that was in the same class as the Roland Juno series.
The Opera 6 came in three versions as it was developing during its lifetime.
First there was a totally analog version with  an Oberheim-style pin-stripe control panel
and one modulation wheel. A matrix of push-buttons enabled program selection.
The later versions replaced the VCOs with DCOs. This meant more stable tuning
without compromising the analog sound. Then, MIDI was also added (with
velocity response ability). Also onboard the Opera were 3 LFOs for lots of
modulation and effects. Its design was intuitive, but quirky - ie: the Pitch/Mod wheels are
far away from the keyboard.A working Juno-106 will smoke the Opera 6 when it comes
to features and MIDI, but sometimes the alternative (Italian) sound of the Opera 6 may be
what you need. It's great for swooshy pads, analog strings, and analog effects.
Bass is OK, brass is ""iffy"", lead sounds are pretty weak as well are percussive/noise
sounds and effects. Unfortunately, there are no effects, not even a Chorus to
thicken up your sounds. MIDI is only 1-part multitimbral and always in OMNI mode,
so it's quite limited. But the velocity responsiveness can control the VCF or ADSR.
In the end it makes a nice piece of collector's kit and can offer some unique
analog pads and sounds - that don't sound like the common Juno!",

individually tweakable. Selected presets will light up LEDs to show you

sounds with independent attack and sustain controls. The Organ section
is 2-voice and has a Celeste sound available as well. The Piano section

to the Orchestra has been used by 808 State and Massive Attack
for some of its great string sounds.The Orchestra 2 was a more flexible version that followed the original
and was released in 1983. It still had 4 preset sounds but offered many
more sliders and edit parameters. The Brass section received a better
filter with cutoff and resonance sliders. The Strings section added Mute
and Percussion sounds to the mix. The Reed or organ section offered an
Accordion and Musette sound in addition to the traditional church organ
sound. And the Piano section added a clavichord sound to its mix. Other
sections include a 5-band graphic EQ, simple LFO, Octave Transposition
and the Animator section, a flange-type effect for ""animating' your
sounds!",

the front of the keys. It gives your studio a good analog/vintage feel.
Most sounds are very basic and fairly unusable. However, its organ tones are
pretty good as well as its 'Cosmic Tone' patch, which uses two

Casio to offer an auto-accompaniment section that continued to feature
on later models. There are 14 Preset sounds including: Organ Flute,
Oboe, Clarinet, Trumpet, Violin, Cello, Piano, Harpsichord, Celeste,
Accordion, Electric Piano, Frog, and Funny. Those last two are basically
synthesizer-type sounds, but Casio obviously had fun with the naming of
those. In addition to the Preset sounds, there is a built-in Drum/Rhythm
section with 16 Presets such as Rock, Bossanova, Waltz, March, Samba,
and Mambo styles.As you may have already guessed from the repeated use of the word,
""Preset,"" none of these sounds or rhythms are programmable; but what do
you expect from a calculator company breaking into the electronic
instrument business? Like a lot of Japanese instrument manufacturers of
the time, Casio was targeting the home keyboard/organ market. But as it
turns out, the CT-401 has some very cool features and the sounds are
actually quite nice as well, such that it made for a great keyboard for
hobbyists that even seasoned musicians could find fun and
interesting.The CT-401 actually looks pretty professional, for its time. The case
uses mostly plastic and metal but has a faux-wood look (any wood used is
actually compressed particle board). The 49-keys are
full sized. And the switches and rocker-switches have that organ-style
that was so prevalent among compact keyboards at this time. A large
built-in speaker is all you need to hear yourself playing with CT-401.
However, there is a mono 1/4-inch output on the back, as well as an
external audio input (to feed some external audio to its speaker). There
are also a headphone jack and three foot-switch / sustain jacks. There
was even a rugged road case available.You can select one Preset sound at a time and although there are no
effects or programming options, there are four switches to turn on
Vibrato, Vibrato Delay, Sustain and Hold. You can choose one of the
Preset Rhythm patterns for some groovy drum percussion to play along
with - the drum sounds themselves were pretty standard for the time and
are reminiscent of the Roland CR-machines. It also has a Fill-In button
to trigger drum fills, and a tempo adjustment knob.The CT-401's ""Casio Auto Chord"" section is the highlight of this
instrument. It can be used like a normal chord-memory feature, where
holding down one of the left-hand keys will play a chord that you have
stored to its memory. The Auto Chord function can play in a staccato or
continuous sustained mode. Or it can be switched to ""Fingered"" mode in
which the chord has a rhythm to it as well as a sort of
walking-bass line. The Auto Chord section can be synchronized to the
Rhythm section as well. Although it's not a truly split keyboard, with
these features you could play a lively rhythm part with just one finger
on your left hand, and solo along with it on the right hand. Along with
the Drum/Rhythm Presets, you could really be a one-man band!",

own take on digital synthesis from the mid-eighties and is found in all
of their CZ series. You basically modify digital waveforms (sine waves)
to create various sounds. It can create wild new sounds, notably
percussive sounds. But it's not too easy to program if you don't know
much about waveform theory and design.Three sets of 8-stage envelope sections are used to modulate your sounds
extensively. The first is used to modify the DCO pitches over time.
Another 8-stage envelope section in the DCW is used to modify the Phase
Angle over time (like filtering). Finally the DCA amplifier also has an
8-stage envelope to modify the volume of sounds over time. For further
tweaking the CZ-1000 employs some surprisingly analog effects. Four
types of Vibrato make up a simple LFO-type section with triangle,
square, ramp up or down waveforms as well as rate, depth and delay
settings. Portamento adds that classic glide effect from one note to the
next. Double up on the oscillators with 4-note polyphony. Built-in noise

generation called ""SD Synthesis"". Short for ""Spectrum
Dynamic"" SD Synthesis has some things in common with the
subtractive synthesis we know and love. The synth takes a waveform and
runs it through a real analog VCF (filter). There are ADSR envelopes for
the DCA and VCF that shape the sound. And there is an LFO just like on a
standard subtractive synth, although this LFO only modulates pitch
(vibrato) and volume (tremolo).Where things get interesting however, is in the choice of waveforms
available from the synth engine. There are 32 incredibly varied
waveforms, some sound very nasal or narrow, some like saw or square
waveforms, some with an odd metallic timbre, and some feature white
noise. It's still a mystery exactly how these waves are created, but
experts suggest they contain a number of harmonically-rich pulse waves
at different octaves, as well as a ring modulator and an analog noise
source.To make things even more interesting, these waves have pre-programmed
amounts of PWM and amplitude modulation built into them. For example,
one SD wave could contain two pulse waves fading in and out at different
times. But you don't have to understand all of this to get the best out
of the synth. The mystery and modulation of it all means you can just
pick a preset and change the waves around and see what happens. The
synth sounds are in the same ballpark as other DCO-synths of the time,
and can even sound a little PPG-like on a good day. The filter is a bit
weak for bass but adds a nice swoosh to some sounds. There is also a
nice chorus effect on board. Additionally, being a home keyboard, it has
built-in speakers, a Drum Machine and an Auto-Accompaniment mode (the
lower tone is used for accompaniment). The drum sounds resemble the
Casio RZ-1 8-bit drum machine.The low point of the synth is in the programming. You have one big
clunky rotary dial and a list of two digit parameters to edit (e.g.: 10
will be cutoff, 11 is resonance) and these parameters are not listed on
the panel, so you need the manual with you at all times! MIDI is
present, but limited to just 3-channels and has no SysEx support. Kind
of a bummer from a synth with such a tedious programming interface.The HT-3000 has several brothers (also released in 1987). They include
the HT-700, which has 49 mini-keys instead of the 3000's 61 full-size
keys. It also has a big brother in the HT-6000, which is a 4 DCO, 8 VCF
and 64 waveform monster! (And the HT-6000 lists the edit parameter codes
on front-panel.) Now, as no one really knows about the HT-series, they
go for very little money and can be a great tool in your synth arsenal
for unusual sounds!",

In principle, the SD synthesizers are digital-analog hybrids with eight voices of polyphony.The first of the SD instruments was a professional looking bitimbral synthesizer HZ-600. This synth was followed by the HT-3000, a home keyboard-like instrument with programmable automatic accompaniment, 61 standard-size keys and built-in loudspeakers; the HT-700 with the same features like HT-3000, but with 49 small keys, and the MT-600, a preset version of the HT-700. All these instruments share an identical sound engine.The only exception in the HT/HZ series is the HT-6000 with more professional features, such as 8 independent filters, 64 waveforms, 4 oscillators per voice, ring modulation and a velocity sensitive keyboard.The Spectrum Dynamic (SD) does mean that some of the 32 digitally generated waves (for Upper voice) evolved with time. In the wave memory, there are also classical sawtooth, square and pulse waves, as well as white noise and combined waves. Each patch uses 1 oscillator only, and there is no possibility to tune the oscillator one octave lower or upper, and there is no sub oscillator. One LFO is available, controlling vibrato only. You can adjust its speed, depth, waveform and delay. The signal goes through a VCF (NJM2090, low-pass 4 pole filter) with adjustable cut-off frequency, resonance (no self-oscillation is achievable) and its own ADSR envelope with adjustable depth. In single mode, only one filter over all eight voices is available, like on the Korg Poly 800, but the HZ-600 (and aforementioned HT-series instruments) has two filters - the other one is used for Lower tones.The DCA envelope (again ADSR with adjustable depth) controls not only the amplification of the patch, but also the behavior of SD waves. The patch stores the settings of the built-in chorus (off, slow weak, slow deep and fast weak) which influences both Upper and Lower tones. In the instrument's memory, there are 20 preset tones, 20 internal tones, which can be re-written by the user, and up to 120 tones can be written on an optional memory card RA-100.Lower tones have only 16 waves to select, vibrato settings are only on/off and Delay, while the instrument uses the vibrato setting of actually playing an upper tone. Lower tones have their own VCF and DCA with identical possibilities like Upper tones. There are 10 Lower tones in ROM, 10 internal and up to 60 Lower tones can be written on the memory card.The instrument allows to adjust pitch-bend range (2, 3, and 5 semitones), transposition (+6 / -5 semitones), to deactivate the Auto Power Off function, and to control the simple MIDI implementation: The basic channel is adjustable between 1 and 15 (for Upper tone), the Lower tone always uses the following higher channel. HZ/HT instruments recognize note on/off, move of wheels (the Modulation must be switched on) and program change commands.Programming of the instrument is done by two switches (Parameter and Value) and on the big Alpha-Dial like a wheel. Fortunately, all parameters are printed on the keyboards front panel which makes this programming method acceptable. The keyboard without velocity and pressure sensitivity looks and feels exactly like the keyboard of CZ-3000/5000. It can be split into one of three split points, but via MIDI, the Lower and Upper tones can be controlled independently, layered over the entire keyboard range, or split anywhere.On the front panel, there are two obligate wheels for pitch-bend and modulation, two volume sliders (main and lower), and a small LCD screen showing the selected program, or mode and value numbers in the Programming mode. In the front of the instrument, there is a headphone output. On the back there are two main outputs, foot volume and sustain pedal inputs, MIDI IN/OUT/THRU trio, power switch, DC 9V input and a small knob for pitch adjustment. The instrument can also be powered by 6 D-size batteries. This is also the only possibility to keep your programs in the RAM, because the memory is volatile and the instrument does not feature tape memory interface. Its MIDI implementation does not allow the memory dump.The overall sound of the instrument is tinny without basses, but the HZ/HT instruments are still capable of some kinds of bells, metallic sounds, some piano, combo organ-like and string sounds, analog brassy leads and certain unusual sound effects and pads with limitations given by its para phonic design.If you are interested in the SD synthesis and if you don't need auto accompaniment and built-in speakers, go for HZ-600. They are really cheap and relatively rare today.",

open/closed hh, ride, crash, cowbell and clap. They don't sound like
real drums, but they do sound electronic and maybe a little different
than more common Roland and Linn drum machines. They have been used in
lots of Hip Hop and House tracks.A real special feature (for its time) was on-board sampling designed to
let you create up to four of your own percussion sounds. Now, the
sampling specs are pretty bad with just a 20kHz sample rate and only 0.2
seconds of sample time per each of the four sample pads (or one 0.8
second sample). Its a very lo-fi sound, which may be a good thing. The
only editing you can do with your samples is a simple low-pass tone
adjust.The built-in sequencer is fairly easy to work with. Just create some
patterns (up to 100) and chain these patterns into songs (up to 20
songs). There are ten individual outputs and volume sliders for every
sound. Well, some sounds have to share outputs and sliders as there are
16 sounds: Rim+Snare, Sample1+Sample2, Sample3+Sample4, Cowbell+Crash,
Clap+Ride and Open+Closed HH. Kind of cool and a little different but

The case design also reflected a more professional approach that Casio was taking; a sleek and minimal all black design free from clutter with a brushed steel front plate, making it a very impressive unit to look at - it is also very well built having an all metal chassis, yet maintains a relatively light weight making it especially good for gigging. The first notable departure from the CZ line is the programming interface, replacing analog-like button per function programming with a page driven system similar to that of the FZ-1 released the previous year. The large (for the time) backlit dot matrix graphic LCD display made programming this synthesizer far easier than Yamaha's DX7 and DX7-II; envelopes and signal path, for example, were edited graphically rather than a number at a time and in text only mode and several parameters were viewable on screen at once. Unlike other synthesizers on the market at the time, the edit pages were not nested and their location and function were clearly marked on the front panel above the menu and function buttons.The VZ-1 takes a hybrid approach to its sound generation. Where the CZ line used Phase Distortion Synthesis and the Yamaha DX line used Phase Modulation (incorrectly advertised as FM), the VZ-1 uses Phase Distortion for ring modulation and waveform generation but true Frequency Modulation Synthesis to generate harmonics. The end result is a unique and hauntingly space-age sounding synthesizer with many smooth ""twangy"" textures - but it can also be very harsh and noisy when complex phasing is employed. Thumping bass-lines and sweeping pads are its strongest points but it is also very capable of analog-ish brass and strings.The Casio VZ-10M rack mountThe voice architecture is similar to the Yamaha DX synthesizers in that you have several oscillators that link together to generate extra harmonics via some form of algorithm. Where the DX7 has six oscillators to choose from, the VZ has eight. Each oscillator is part of a ""module"" and each module has a long list of functions independent of the other modules: Waveform, detune, envelope, envelope depth (that also functions as oscillator volume), envelope velocity sensitivity, envelope key follow and amplifier sensitivity. Each module is then arranged in 4 pairs: A, B, C and D. The first module in a pair then has the option to mix with the second module (similar to a dual oscillator synthesizer), ring modulate the second module or phase modulate the second module. The output from this can then be sent to the main output, or used to modulate the second module of the following pair (for example: the output from Pair A modulates the second module in Pair B which is also being ring modulated with the first module in Pair B). This freedom to pick and choose your own voice combinations allows for some very wild and complex sounds.Aftertouch was also rather generous for the time too, allowing modulation of vibrato depth and rate, tremolo depth and rate, portamento time, pitch modulation and envelope bias.The VZ-1 also features a combination mode that lets you stack up to 4 patches on top of each other giving a total of 32 oscillators per voice. Working in combination mode does lower polyphony, however, with 4 patches only allowing monophonic operation. Each patch in a combination could then be velocity switched, velocity triggered, crossfaded, have their tremolo and vibrato inverted, detuned, transposed and split across the keyboard. Even today, this is an impressive list of features for a non-workstation synthesizer. The keyboard also has two outputs that come in great use when controlling over MIDI or when playing split. Some careful trickery with Tremolo in combination mode with these two outputs can also give you a stereo panning effect.There are some drawbacks, however. Where other synthesizers of the time could store up to 128 patches in memory, the VZ only has 64 (8 banks of 8 slots) and the ROM cards were limited to a max of 64 patches due to the way the front panel was laid out. The synthesizer does not contain any onboard effects or a sequencer and the presets are of the typical cheap Japanese keyboard affair - with the only usable patches out the box being the DX7-ish slap bass guitar and e-piano.Although easy to program, especially when compared to a D-50 or a DX7, the long list of parameters that need to be edited for each individual module make this synthesizer very tedious to program larger sounds and textures. Add on the complexity of its sound engine and how twitchy it can be and it may end up frustrating to those not well versed in synthesizer technology.Despite these failings, the synthesizer is still bewilderingly powerful and versatile if you spend time to become better aquaintted with it and it can easily become the focal point of any track with its uniquely warm yet cutting tonality. They do often spring up at low prices but have been increasing in popularity recently; some units in good condition can fetch up to £400, more-so if an RC-100 ROM Card is included.Update:  Unlike the Yamaha ""FM"" synths, the VZ-1 or VZ-10m can be stacked under multiple VZ-8m modules (six max.) for up to 64 independent voices of polyphony, which is 512 oscillators/operators total, double that of the also-amazing Kurzweil K150 additive synthesizer (240 partials.) The TX816 can provide up to 128 voices and can currently be had for about $1000 on eBay. The VZ still has better audio and more versatile algorithms.",

parameters and controls are available from the knobs and switches on the
front panel in an intuitive and clearly labeled layout - bringing
old-school analog synthesis to the modern MIDI studio.The Neptune is actually a lot like the ProTone, except that the Neptune achieves its
third VCO by substituting the LFO as an audible oscillator (Osc 3 can be
switched between LFO--slow--and Oscillator Mode--fast) and by adding a
dedicated ADSR envelope to the 24dB/oct cascade filter. The Neptune also
includes an audio input for processing external signals through its
filter and LFO. Like the ProTone, it features both MIDI I/O and CV+Gate
I/O and can handle MIDI-to-CV+Gate conversion (across a 5 octave range),
making it an ideal synth for old-school and modern MIDI studios. It also
features MIDI controlled filter cutoff and modulation control as well as
velocity sensitivity. The original Neptune model debuted in 1999 and
came in Violet, Silver or Gold colored panels.Neptune 2In 2003 the updated mkII or Neptune 2 was released. Improvements
included a cool new look, smoother pots, soft touch knobs, higher

increased tuning range for all three oscillators.The Neptune models represent a truly analog synth with an all analog

memory storage. But it's such a breeze to use, and with every knob
available, it's truly a synth tweaker's machine, capable of fat bass and
synth sounds to weird bubbly and resonant noises. Yet despite its MIDI
capability, the knobs do not transmit MIDI data for control of real-time
data in to a sequencer. It does, however, respond to MIDI controller
data for the filter cutoff, modulation, portamento,
sustain and velocity. There is a Learn button for MIDI Channel and
Reference note and the MIDI Thru signal is regenerated, not amplified,

sound is authentic, and their cost is incredibly reasonable. They make an
excellent alternative to older vintage synths.",

table-top 8-voice polyphonic synthesizer suitable for anybody who wants
affordable analog sounds for use in most any style of electronic music.
Analog sounds are created by DSP-based analog modeling which means
you'll get reliable and clean analog-type synth sounds in an economical
and professional instrument. The DarkStar features 2 oscillators per
voice, 5-part multitimbral set-up, joystick mixing for oscillators, ring
modulation, filter resonance and pink/white/blue noise generators.Its unique look is modeled after RSS's other DJ tools. There are 14
knobs, all of which transmit MIDI data and provide instant hands-on
access to the filters and envelopes. The two LFOs and two envelope
generators provide plenty of modulation abilities for the oscillators,
pulse-width and filter. The filter offers high-, low- and band-Pass
filtering with a 12dB/oct slope. It's not spectacular, but it is fairly
flexible since both the cutoff and resonance can be modulated by either
LFO and EG for a wide range of filter-sweeping effects.The DarkStar has a simple yet powerful upgrade system as well. By simply
plugging-in an EPROM chip into a compartment on its underside you can
get an entirely new synth such as a vocoder or mega-mono synth. The
DarkStar certainly has some interesting concepts and good sounds at a
very affordable price, though this low price may be noticed in the
construction and design of the machine. Still it may just be too good to
pass up if you're on a budget!An optional upgrade kit converts the DARKSTAR into the VOCODA - a fully featured vocoder with 
five operating modes. Featuring 11-band filtering / noise generation, this simple 
EPROM chip D.I.Y. upgrade will allow you to combine external sounds (voice or loops)
with an external sound source for classic vocoder sounds, that's the Standard Vocoder
mode (1). Use the DARKSTAR's internal osc. and 'S' detector for true 'robotic' style vocoding (2). 
The Filter Mode (3) can be used to process any stereo signal through the 11-band stereo filter 
for cool filter sweeps. The Sequence-coder Mode (4) and Synthesizer Mode (5) use
the 8-step formant sequencer to control the vocoder filters on external sounds or
the internal oscillators. Additional MIDI envelope control, vocoder phrase step-recording,
15 preset vowels via sound palette, and more! Upgrade kit includes VOCODA decal for DARKSTAR.	",

to experiment with creating random sounds, hopefully leading to some
happy accidents! Your custom creations can be stored in any of 127 user
patches. There are also 127 preset patches and 90 multi-patches (aka
performances). The Multi-patches can have up to eight different patches
for creating some very lush arrangements.The Elevata is also upgradeable via EPROMs you can buy for a little over

The rare Davolisint
was released in 1972. It's not so much a synthesizer as it is a
monophonic organ. And while it may be a historic instrument in terms of
Italy's contribution to synthesizers, the Davolisint is actually kind of
awkward and leaves a lot to be desired for us 21st century folks.It was produced by Davoli Krundaal Musical SRL, a small Italian company
that manufactured various musical accessories and organs. The Davolisint
began their foray into synthesis. It offered two analog oscillators with
only one very harsh square waveform, independent vibrato for each
oscillator and portamento. And that was pretty much all! No filters,
envelopes or oscillator syncing. The only real option available to shape
the sound was the ability to detune the two VCOs. And before getting too
excited about it having two VCOs, remember that they have the exact same
waveform. The keyboard is only playable over two-octaves; the lower grey
keys of the keyboard are redundant momentary switches that mirror the
controls of the rocker switches above.On the left-hand side of the keyboard are rocker switches to engage the
various footages of the oscillators, from 32' all the way up to an
ear-piercing 1/2'. Multiple footages could be engaged at one time
creating a full sound many octaves thick. However, this is not
polyphony—the Davolisint is monophonic and uses an octave
divide-down technology to layer octaves of the same note. The rocker
switches on the right side turn on or off VCO1, VCO2, Vibrato 1, Vibrato
2, T1 and T2 (which engage increasing amounts of portamento) and
C—a sort of constant drone of the low C note. In the middle there
are sliders to adjust the tuning of VCO1 and VCO2, and the rates and
depths of Vibrato 1 and Vibrato 2. All that remains is the
""Extend"" lever which is a spring loaded pitch bend—pull
it down and the pitch bends upward one full octave, and then the lever
slowly returns to its default position.So most of these basic rocker switches—footage, Vibrato 1 and 2,
T1 and T2 and C all have redundant control from the keys within the grey
octave. The idea was probably that while playing, it would be easier to
make quick changes to your current settings right from the keyboard
instead of reaching for the rockers. For example, want to quickly add a
dose of vibrato to VCO2 during that solo, just hold down the VIB 2 key
while playing, as needed. Or you could add extra octave footages while
playing, just to articulate some variations to the sound, or to shift
the keyboard up or down some octaves. In fact, creative use of the grey
keys could actually lead to some really dynamic performance results not
really possible with traditional synths.While the Davolisint may seem like something that, arguably even
deserves to be called a synthesizer, it should be remembered that the
year was 1972. Compact synthesizers were only just beginning to emerge.
In fact many synths about to appear in this era included analog
synthesizers based on scaled down modular systems, string synthesizers
and organ-based divide-down synths like this one. In other words, the
synthesizer world was still developing. So limitations aside, the
Davolisint does deserve a place in history as being the first Italian
synthesizer, soon to be followed by those from Crumar, Siel, Logan,
Elka, EKO and Jen. It has been used by Dave Sinclair of Caravan
and the Moog Cookbook.Amazingly, the Davolisint inspired a free VST soft synth version in the
Elektrostudio
DavoSynth (circa 2009). It's pretty faithful too, except for stereo sound and
delay, chorus and adjustable pitch bend range.",

Yes, this is another TB-303 clone. It's very simple and straightforward with basic controls that mirror those found on the TB-303. While it does not actually do a particularly good job at emulating the TB-303 sound, it is still a true analog MIDI-controlled bass synth with plenty of thumpin' bass potential of its own. The DB9 is a single-unit rack module with all ten of its knobs on the front panel. There are no hidden menus. Just like the TB-303, the DB9's single oscillator offers two waveforms to choose from - a sawtooth or square wave. That is followed by the 303-cloned Tuning, filter Cut Off Frequency and Resonance, Env Mod, Decay and Accent knobs. Additionally you can set the DB9 to one of the 16 standard MIDI channels, and you can set it to use its external audio input instead of the oscillator allowing you to process external audio through its analog filter (inputs and outputs are mono).Speaking of filters, a big part of the TB-303 sound is defined by its unique 18 dB/oct filter. Unfortunately the DB9 is not using an 18 dB/oct filter, which is one major factor contributing to its poor emulation the TB-303. The DB9 uses a 24 dB/oct filter which still sounds great - just not very 303-like. It also has a limited frequency cut-off control but a strong resonance control. The resulting sound, although not quite as sharp in the mid range as a TB-303, seems much more deep and warm.Of course, since the DB9 has no on-board TB-303-like sequencer, MIDI control is essential. The all-import Accent feature of the TB-303 is controlled here by MIDI note velocity - and turning up the Accent knob dials in how much it affects, not the volume of the note, but the filter's frequency and loudness. There is a hidden Glide control, although this is more like a portamento that seems to add some extra release on the envelope.The Glide and the Cut Off Frequency are the only two parameters that can be controlled via MIDI CC. Unfortunately, none of the knobs output MIDI CC data, which means all live control changes need to be performed and/or recorded live. There is also, sadly, no memory onboard for storing some of your settings. So you'll have to resort to old school patch setting storage techniques with the DB9. But on the bright side, the DB9 has a built-in CV/Gate converter with inputs and outputs. So it can either be used with some older pre-MIDI equipment you may have or it can be used to bring certain pre-MIDI equipment into the world of MIDI.There are better alternatives for a TB-303 clone out there (like the x0xb0x for instance) but the DB9 comes close. Its strength is that it has its own natural and warm unique sound which has many sweet spots. The sawtooth and square waves are very thick and full sounding, and you can push the resonance right up till it howls. It sits in a mix very well too, so it makes for an ideal dedicated bass synthesizer module. And they're fairly cheap too!",

during the era of the classic samplers. Its function is to load 3.5"" and
5"" diskettes containing samples. These samples are loaded into its 1 MB
of RAM from which you can play the samples using any MIDI keyboard,
controller or sequencer. It was compatible with the E-mu Emulator II, Sequential Prophet 2000, 2002, 2002+, Ensoniq Mirage DSK8/DMS8 and the Akai S900 formats. You can't really edit any of
the samples, the DPX1 is simply a load-n-play machine. Its universality
among these early samplers makes it great for anyone who may still have
old disks of samples but not the samplers that created them. With the
DPX1 you can resurrect those samples and use them again, or resample
them into a modern sampler. Sounds can also be re-stored in an Oberheim
DPX format on to 3.5"" disks. A 20MB Hard Disk model was also made
available around 1988.The DPX1 has a very impressionable architecture. That is, it recalls the
nuances of you're samples including any processing, looping, filtering
and modulations resulting in very accurate reproductions of the samples
as they would have sounded through their original Sampler synths.
However you can't edit, alter, re-program or create new samples. Ensoniq
and E-mu samples come through sounding just like they're being played
out of the original synths, if not better. However, the Sequential
sounds are not quite as nice when played from the DPX1 and cannot be
stacked as they may be in the Prophet. Full MIDI and 4-part
multitimbrality equip the DPX1 for easy use in any studio. The DPX1 has
limited potential, but if you have the samples (and not the Samplers)
this is an economic way to recover and hear those classic samples again.",

can also be used so you can punch in and out of loops without having to
use your hands...so you can keep playing.The Echoplex is also fully MIDI capable. All controls send/receive MIDI
data and even the Loops can be saved and loaded via MIDI! MIDI sync makes sure
your loops can be locked  to the tempo of your MIDI sequencers giving
the Echoplex a niche in your MIDI-studio as a dedicated loop-player!
Loops, like samples, can be assigned to keys on a keyboard and can
be triggered as loops or single-shot samples. Other functions
of the Echoplex include Reverse, for backwards loops, and a Multiplay
feature which repeats loops a user-defined number of times to create
an extended loop (ie: extend a 4-beat loop into a 16-beat loop).
Unfortunately there are no robust effects available such as
filtering, time stretching, pitch shifting, stereo-effects, or
resampling. But it is a lot more practical, reliable, and cleaner sounding
than any old analog tape-based Echoplex from the 1960's!! It has been used 
by Brian Eno, U2, and Crystal Distortion.The original Oberheim Exhoplex was initially released in 1994. Later,
in 2001 it was relabeled the Gibson Echoplex after Gibson took over
Oberheim. Then it was reissued in 2003 in a slightly upgraded form as
the Gibson Echoplex Digital Pro Plus (pictured above in black).",

Vintage Synth. It is essentially eight classic Oberheim SEM modules stacked together alongside the
Polyphonic Synthesizer Programmer for memory, a simple analog mixer, and
a 49-note keyboard. This gives you an eight voice polyphonic/polytonal
synthesizer with 16 VCO's, 8 VCFs, 16 ADR envelope generators and more.
In the late '70s a really cool 2-tier keyboard version was released with
a larger 61 note keyboard added below the standard 49 note keyboard.Because the Eight Voice derives its polyphony from having eight
mono-synth modules hard-wired together, it has some pros and cons. What
is cool is that this was a lot of simultaneous voices for the
mid-seventies. And the ability to craft a different sound on each voice
led to some diverse and complex sounds. However, it also meant you have
to program each voice independently. Fortunately the Polyphonic
Synthesizer Programmer stores 16 patches per voice (all of which can be
different) so you can save all that hard work spent programming sounds.The Eight Voice was the pinnacle of Oberheim's first synth system,
completely based around the simple little SEM. But a need for truly
polyphonic circuit designs would soon lead to Oberheim's legendary
OB-series, leaving the SEM based poly-synths behind in the 1970's... It
has been used by Herbie Hancock, Styx, and Rush.",

polyphony because there are basically four discrete mono-synths all
connected together. This has its pros and cons. What is cool is that
this was a lot of simultaneous voices for the mid-seventies. And the
ability to craft a different sound on each voice led to some diverse and
complex sounds. However, it also meant you have to program each voice
independently. Each voice also has its own independent audio output.The Polyphonic Synthesizer Programmer, released in 1976 and added to the
Four Voice stores 16 patches per voice (all of which can be different).
The Four Voice could accommodate an additional four SEMs, making it just
like the Eight Voice model which officially
appeared in 1977.Unfortunately the Four Voice was blown out of the competition by the
release of the polyphonic Sequential Prophet-5, which offered true polyphony with
a single set of sound shaping controls and comprehensive patch memory.

out during the mid-eighties following the classic OB-series. The Matrix
6 utilized high-tech but less expensive digital and midi features and
still retained a totally analog sound. It did this by using DCOs
(digitally controlled oscillators) to provide stability, programmability
and more. All the Matrix synthesizers featured Matrix Modulation which
allows for extremely wild virtual patching for almost unlimited range of
sounds and modulation capabilities!The Matrix 6 is a very popular synthesizer today because it offers
access to the legendary sounds and power of the Matrix 12, though not as meaty but at a fraction
of the cost. The Matrix 6 is also like the Xpander, but with only 6 voices of polyphony
and slimmer programming. Each of its 6 voices has a pair of DCOs, a low
pass filter, 2 VCA's, 3 envelope generators, 2 LFO's, and 2 ramp gens
for a variety of complex analog pads, basses and sounds.The programmability is vast, but it can be very tedious. As was the
growing trend in synthesizers during this time, knobs and sliders were
replaced by just a few membrane buttons and a simple data slider. This
is accompanied by gobs of programming and patch data written across the
face of the unit. Fortunately Midi SysEx is fully supported so you can
get patches on-line and transmit them into the Matrix. Access, makers of the Virus, 
used to make the Matrix Programmer
which gives you much more user friendly hands-on controls too. And software
editors such as Unisyn make graphic editing possible for much easier
programming.The Matrix 6R (pictured above) is the Matrix 6 without a keyboard,
retaining its membrane programming interface. Oberheim later produced
the Matrix 1000, which is essentially 1000
patches from the Matrix 6 in a 1-unit rack-module, preset and editable
only through SysEx.	For professional studio work or live on stage,

synthesizer designed by Don Buchla. Buchla has sort of disowned this
unit, though. Its filters are actually pretty bad. They don't manage to

sound notoriously thin and tweezy. The so-called 'Oberheim filter'

The OB-SX featured the same VCO/VCF/VCAs of the OB-X and a voice card design similar to the OB-Xa
in which polyphony was based on the number of 2-voice PCB cards
installed (using CEM/Curtis chips).  Sacrifices were made to the OB-X's ""knob for each function""
programming interface (replaced in the ""SX"" by a few realtime only 
filter and envelope controls), the ability to save patches (all sounds
were preset in ROM) and the last octave of the keyboard (""chopped"" to 48
notes).  Despite the sacrifices, the OB-SX faithfully reproduces the
character (and at times the ""ill temper"" of an all analog design) of the
OB-X and OB-Xa.  The preset sounds are a bit dated (e.g. early funk & late prog
rock), but still usable and the realtime controls allow a good amount of
""shaping"" to be done. It's important to note that like all Oberheim
synths, the OB-SX was a continual work in progress and there were many
different revisions made to the OB-SX during its life time.  
Major revisions included: Early units had 24 presets and mid units had 48
presets and late units had 56 presets (later units had a slide switch on
the back to change between banks of presets).  The color/case design was 
changed from the (early units) black & gray
of the OB-X to the (later units) black & blue pinstripes of the OB-Xa
and OB-8.Early on Oberheim
offered OB-SX purchasers the option of sending in cassette dumps of
their OB-X patches and burning them into OB-SX ROMs, so there's the
possiblity that the presets in an OB-SX may be unique to that specific
unit. Somewhere during production the pre-MIDI ""Oberheim System""
digital interface was added to the OB-SX, allowing the OB-X to interface
with the Oberheim DSX sequencer. Like all early analog synths the OB-SX
is vulnerable to voltage and temperature changes (so make sure you allow
the unit to fully warm up and use a voltage regulator/battery backup)
and some ICs and replacement parts are now extinct - try before you buy!",

amount of patch memory storage found on many OB-Xa's is 120 patch

attributed to its great filters and sounds.The OB-X was very similar to the OB-Xa except
that its voices could not be split or layered and, more significantly, the OB-X had 
a lowpass-only discrete SEM 12dB/oct state variable filter, which had a great and

increase stability by switching to CEM3320 Curtis chips for its filters.
The Xa offered two switchable filter modes: 12 dB/oct (2-pole) or
24 dB/oct (4-pole). This hardware change resulted in a
more agressive sound, not quite as creamy as the OBX original,
but what still became a ""bread and butter"" sound of the Oberheim line.Splitting the
keyboard mode separates the OB-Xa into two 4-voice synths with two

OB-Xk can also send a sequencer Song Select, Start and Stop commands.
It's built with Oberheim's classic & vintage look: solid black metal case with wood end-cheeks.
Definitely a unique controller to have around, although severely limited
by today's standards.",

Synthesizer Expander Module. It was conceived with the notion of being
used as a backup synth connected to a sequencer for layering or beefing
up your existing monophonic analog synths. The SEM itself was a
keyboard-less module with two analog oscillators, a 2-pole multimode
filter, ADR envelopes, and an LFO. Each of the two oscillators offer
triangle or rectangular waveforms. But unlike the Moog and ARP
counterparts of the time, the SEM's 2-pole (12dB/oct) filter was a
little thin. The others used a 4-pole (24dB/oct) filter which has a
steeper roll-off and so it sounds much better. But the SEM's filter
offered many modes in addition to low-pass, including high-pass,
band-pass and band-reject.Although SEM modules and other external controllers could be
inter-connected, the SEM is not a patchable synth module like other
modular type synths of the time. Its signal routing was more or less,
hard-wired. The SEM was for all purposes, an accessory. But Oberheim
jumped into the synth market by coupling SEMs with a keyboard and an
analog sequencer into a compact, white, little performance synth. That
led to the Two Voice, Four Voice and Eight
Voice models. And from there, came the rest of Oberheim's history of
instruments. Some earlier SEMs have several differences in their circuit
design that affects the envelopes, filter, etc. If your SEM has ""1080""
written inside, it's an early one. If you see ""1180"", it's the ""normal""
one that most people know and love.Pictured just above is the Polyphonic Synthesizer Programmer, introduced
in 1976. It could be used with the SEM and the Two-, Four-, and
Eight-Voice models. The unique feature this programmer had (for its
time) was the ability to store the knob settings of a SEM modules
parameters. Neither Moog nor ARP could offer memory/patch storage like
this at the time. The PSP could accommodate up to 8 SEMs or, in other
words, the Eight Voice. SEMs have been used by Jan Hammer, Josef
Zawinul, and filmaker/composer John Carpenter.",

them back to your MIDI sound source (Synthesizer or Sampler) just as
they would be played from a guitar. Not only will the chord voicings be
correct, but the chords can actually be ""Strummed!"" With the ""Strummer,""
you can even change the speed and direction of your ""Strums"" just by
changing the way you play your MIDI keyboard. Also, ""Strummer"" has the
ability to distinguish the difference between chords and single notes,
allowing you to send chords out on one MIDI channel (Distorted Guitar
Sound for example) while your single notes are sent out on a different
channel (i.e. Solo Sound). Your keyboard may have a great guitar sound,
but can you play a great guitar part? Yes. The Oberheim Strummer will
transform your keyboard playing into a stunning and convincing
performance featuring realistic guitar articulation.By looking at such factors as the range of the guitar, the number of
notes being played, chord position, and the velocity of the performance,
Strummer can transform the incoming MIDI data out into performance data
emulating that of a real guitarist. Performance data may be delayed,
echoed, harmonized, transposed and sent back out on multiple MIDI
channels. In addition to control over strum direction and speed, the
Strummer also features Chord Capture for real time single finger chords.
Individual picking patterns and riffs may be assigned to a single key,
for real time performance playback. You can even control the number of
""strings"" being strummed via keyboard velocity.Some additional features include: Adjustable Delay and Decay Rates. Velocity
Switching. Chord Voicing Variations. Chord Capture (Adjustable Single
Finger Chords). Transposition of MIDI Delays (Great for MIDI
Harmonizing). Ability to synchronize to MIDI Timing Clocks (External

However, in
1975, Oberheim created their first compact, programmable and polyphonic
synthesizer by coupling two SEM modules to a 37-note keyboard and a
simple analog sequencer. This was what became the Two Voice. Oberheim
achieved a polyphonic sound not yet seen in ARP and Moog gear at the
time by hard-wiring the two monophonic SEMs into the compact keyboard
design.In 1976 Oberheim came out with another module, the Polyphonic
Synthesizer Programmer (see SEM). This could
memorize the control voltages of many parameters for up to eight SEM
modules. When these were added to the Two Voice, Oberheim finally had
one of the earliest programmable and polyphonic instruments! Released
alongside the Two Voice also came the Four
Voice which had four SEMs installed, and a larger 49-note keyboard.
And later, in 1977, a second tier was added above the four SEMs on the
Four Voice to add yet another four SEMS, making the Eight Voice.Two voices was great in 1975, and eight voices was pretty monstrous in
the later seventies. But, a major drawback to these first Oberheim
synths was that polyphony was achieved by having multiple modules. This
meant that each voice had to be independently programmed. This also
means that each voice has its own filter, making real-time filter sweeps
of all your voices more than a handful! Fortunately the sequencer comes
in handy for controlling each voice/module independently.Despite its innovative features, the Two Voice was soon blown out of the
water by the popular monophonic and truly polyphonic synths like the OSCar, ARP Odyssey and SH-101. The Two Voice has been used by
Vince Clarke and Vangelis.",

architecture. In many ways they are the most flexible non-modular analog
synths ever built. Each voice has five LFOs, each with about five
different wave shapes, plus the ability to sample most other modulators;
five envelopes that can repeat themselves, sync to an LFO, and so on; a
lag processor (like portamento, but more general); three tracking generators
(that apply a series of linear functions to a value over its range);
some ramp generators (the attack portion of an envelope); a 15-mode
filter and a user interface to make all of this accessible.Another very useful feature is its CV/gate to MIDI conversion
capabilities for communication with older synths. There are six CV and
Gate inputs which use standard 1V/8va CV and positive gating. So you can
connect up to 6 external sources delivering CV/Gate and convert that
into MIDI. Ample output options offer stereo and mono outputs as well as
six additional individual audio outputs (1 for each voice) allowing you
to use the Xpander as a stereo polyphonic 6-voice synth, as six
individual monosynths or any combination in between. There's even a 3rd
party Mod (Oddernmart mod) that allows for an external audio input that
can be routed through the filter. And like The Matrix synths, the
Xpander sounds wonderful, capable of thick analog basses, pads and
textures. It is used by Cirrus, Josh Wink, Astral Projection, Vince
Clarke, DJ Sasha, Chemical Brothers, Meat Beat Manifesto and Nine Inch
Nails.",

machine to bear the BOSS Dr. Rhythm brand (the
DR-55), offering four sounds, an Accent and
a limited number of programmable patterns. It was followed by the Dr.
Rhythm Graphic (DR-110) in 1983, which offers a wider selection of
sounds, preset patterns, an increased number of programmable patterns
and the ability to chain patterns together to form songs. The simple
step programming of the first Dr. Rhythm, with alternating button
presses for notes and rests, is augmented by an LCD with a grid showing
the individual notes in the current pattern. In addition to step
programming there is also a ""tap write"" programming mode,
albeit without a metronome click for timekeeping.The sounds are Kick, Snare, Closed Hi-Hat, Open Hi-Hat, Cymbal and Clap.
The sounds are totally analog, and sound crisp and punchy, thanks to
tone generation circuitry that is more sophisticated than the Roland
TR-606 Drumatix. A balance knob alters the
level of the Kick, Snare and Clap relative to the other sounds, while an
accent knob controls the amount of emphasis applied to accented steps.
There is also a volume knob, which controls the overall level of both
the main and headphone outputs. The main output is mono, but has an
unusual feature whereby plugging in a suitable wired lead with a stereo
jack plug allows for the feeding in of another signal to be mixed with
the drum sounds. Another socket provides for a trigger signal, emitting
a pulse for every accented step in a pattern.The patterns are organized into four banks of eight patterns each. Banks
C and D are the presets, while banks A and B are programmable. Each
pattern can be switched between 12 or 16 steps, for a 3/4 or 4/4 time
signature. Two songs can be programmed, each containing a maximum of 128
bars.At the time of writing, the Dr. Rhythm Graphic is relatively affordable
compared to similar machines such as the Roland
TR-606 Drumatix, and are usually found in
good condition thanks to the padded carry case that they came with. On
the downside, there are no outputs or tone controls for the individual
sounds, but a number of well documented modifications can be found on

cutoff, resonance and decay parameters (for instant tweaking of
individual instrument sounds); reverb and delay effects; Tap Tempo
control for realtime BPM adjustment and 13 pads for triggering sounds
from any of its 128 kits. The way the pads are laid out gives you 2
kicks, 2 snares, 2 hi hats (one open, one closed), a ride, a crash, 2
percussion, and 3 hit pads. Each pad also has a separate send to the
effects which is nice but the effects can also be applied to all the
drums at once.A 3-track sequencer (which offers a 13-part drum track and a dedicated
bass track) lets you build a rhythm from scratch in either step or live
edit modes. Up to 20 complete songs can be stored in the DR-202's
internal memory. There's even an external source track for triggering

step-write-style drum machines, and it was the first rhythm machine in
BOSS' successful Dr. Rhythm Series. It was small, inexpensive and easy

and sounds made this drum machine an instant hit among guitarists and
other musicians looking for drum accompaniment to practice along with
and even record into their home recordings.The DR-55 could store up to six 16-step drum patterns plus an additional
two 12-step patterns. The 12-step patterns allowed for 3/4 and 6/8
rhythms. A variation switch allowed you to, on-the-fly, alter the
pattern playing. There were only four sounds in the DR-55 which
included Snare Drum, Kick Drum, Rim Shot and Hi-Hat. The sounds are
comparable to Roland's CR-series of rhythm machines as well as some of
Roland's cheaper TR-machines (like the TR-505, TR-606). You can globally
adjust the Volume, Tempo, Tone and Accent for the drum sounds.Step-Mode programming was accomplished in a fairly basic manner: Switch
the DR-55 into Write Mode and select a sound from the Sound switch, and
use the Start button to place the sound and the Stop button to step
through the 16 (or 12) beat pattern. Only Kick, Snare, Rim Shot and
Accent could be placed in a pattern in step mode--the Hi-Hats could only
be programmed as either Off, 8ths, 12ths or 16ths via the Hi-Hat switch.
Primitive programming for sure, but very simple and effective.Today, where its sounds can easily be sampled, the DR-55 may seem pretty useless. However it does have an
authentic sense of nostalgia being BOSS' first DR-machine and also quite a
successful early programmable drum machine. You may not find a need for
such an instrument today although it does make a great conversation
piece! It has been used by New Order, The Cure, Chris Carter, Sisters 
of Mercy, Chris & Cosey, Xeno & Oaklander, Soft Cell and Thomas Dolby.",

top and a thick rubber trigger pad. There is also a 9V DC socket for
use with an external power supply.The HC-2 is a single-function hand clap synthesizer. It sounds similar
to the TR-808/909
clap, and uses a variation on the same circuit. White noise is filtered
and shaped, and here the user has some control over that—a Dry
control determines the brightness of the sound (tone), and a Hall
control determines the tail length (reverberation).The unit can be used alone, with the sound being triggered by tapping
the pad, or in conjunction with various drum machines or
sequencers—a 1/4"" input jack takes a positive trigger voltage
pulse. The strength of the trigger, coupled with the Sensitivity
control, determines the volume of the sound.Simple in operation, the HC-2 is a useful addition to drum machines such
as the DR-55 and

outputs and lack clap sounds themselves. It is also good fun to play
manually, and varying tap strength can be used to good effect; rolls are
also very easy to achieve when played using the fingers.",

case sports controls on the top and a thick rubber trigger pad. There is

to help shape various synth drum, percussion and effect sounds. It uses
a single VCO with a triangle waveform and a knob to adjust its pitch.
The sound is more often of the UFO bleep and bloop variety, although
with a bit of help from the OEM manual, you can find the settings to
make big bass drum sounds, castanets, tom toms, wood blocks and more.
The Sweep knob can give the sound an ascending or descending pitch bend
effect. The VCA envelope is limited to a simple Decay control (attack is
a fixed hard transient). A simple LFO, switchable between Triangle or
Square waveforms, with Depth and Rate controls can be used to modulate
the VCO for subtle vibrato to crazy wobbly sounds.The unit can be used standalone, with the sound being triggered by
tapping the pad, or in conjunction with various drum machines,
sequencers, or even a guitar—a 1/4"" input jack takes a
positive trigger voltage pulse. The strength of the trigger, coupled
with the Sensitivity control, determines the volume of the sound. Oh and
the Trigger pad is incredibly sensitive. It can take anything from the
slightest touch to the hardest whack of a drum stick, and the differing
velocities don't just alter the volume, they can seem to slightly
transform the sound as well. Output is from a mono 1/4"" jack.On its own the PC-2 may not look too exciting. But it is an analog
synthesizer built in to a rock solid pedal. Its simplicity belies the
wide range of true analog sounds that can be coaxed out of the little
unit. And they can be had for fairly cheap prices. Coupled with some
other external effects such as distortion or delay, the PC-2 can add
some extra color to a percussion part or just make for some fun and
weird synth bleeps and bloops.The Amdek
PCK-100 is an identical DIY kit version of the Boss PC-2 that
you assemble yourself. The Amdek version provided for some simple
modifications in their instructions to add some extra flavor. One mod
allows for the rear switch to change the VCO waveform between the
standard triangle and either a square wave or combined square/triangle
wave. Other mods allow for changes to the VCO and LFO  frequency ranges
and the VCA decay time. And certainly there may also be some creatively
circuit-bent models floating around too.",

In fact tempos are calculated for each loop automatically, and individual samples 
can't be pitch shifted, tempo adjusted, or have their volumes altered.
It also lacks any re-sampling abilities, and with only four voices, the
musical possibilities are quite limited. But it's great for the DJ who wants to run

banks (4 preset and 12 user). Sampling specs are limited to CD-quality
44.1 kHz (which yields about 2 minutes of sample-time) as well as
22.050 and 11.025 kHz sample rates (more sample time, but less sound
quality). The sampler is expandable via SmartMedia cards (3.3V only,
up to an additional 128MB). It imports AIFF and WAV audio file
formats. Of course, it also samples external audio coming in from any
of its four input sources. As the machine is based on flash-RAM, every
sample is instantly available to play, there's no need to load and
wait. In addition to sampled sounds, there are an additional 64
onboard Tones with drums, bass, keyboard and synth sounds.The samples can be manipulated in various ways: A graphic LCD
display allows you to edit a sample's start and end points or boost
the level of a specific waveform range. A Pitch function can map a
sample to the 16 pads chromatically like a traditional sampler does.
There's a BPM Sync feature to instantly match up to 16 phrases to the
same tempo. The new Chop function divides a loop and maps it in to
individual samples and assigns them to the pads. The Chop function
thus allows you to rework a loop in to an entirely different groove -
on the fly.There are 16 pads (not velocity sensitive) to trigger the samples
that also light up to indicate whenever the sample assigned to them is 
playing. The Pattern
Sequencer has 4 tracks with independent quantization and
groove/shuffle settings. This allows you to create complete music
productions with a loop track, additional sequenced drum track, bass
track and synth track, for example. Pattern creation is possible with
realtime recording or microscope editing (a sort of step sequencing
that lets you edit the sequence while the pattern is playing). A
Pattern Select feature makes changing patterns easy using the 16 pads,
which is great for live performance.Also onboard are 26 effects (same as the SP-303) including
Isolator, Filter+Drive, Slicer, Reverb, Tape Echo, Vinyl Simulator and
more. All of the effects can be controlled in real time using the
knobs, or even re-sampled to another pad. There's also an ""EXT
SOURCE"" pad to mix/process the external audio-in source in real time.
Speaking of connections, the SP-505 has the typical DJ-oriented
options: stereo RCA ins/outs, MIC in (1/4 inch) and Headphones (1/4
inch). But it also offers a Digital Input (optical and coaxial), MIDI
In/Out and a foot switch input jack.The SP-505 is a compact, all-in-one groove machine, phrase sampler,
sequencer and effects processor that sounds really good for the price
and is also very user friendly. For budding musicians and especially
the DJ-oriented bunch looking to create their own beats and sample-based
music, the SP-505 is a good place to get started.",

better in the SYB-3. The tracking is better than SYB-3's, and the price

it has built-in digital reverb. There are four prominent sliders for the
aforementioned effects. And the Robot button does in fact produce a
somewhat vocoder-like sound by fixing the pitch of your voice and
fuzzing it. Using the Robot effect in conjunction with the formant and
pitch sliders can get some pretty weird vocoder sounds.The VT-1 has mic-input with adjustable trim level so you can run your

transform away with this affordable and simple table-top effect unit.
The VT-1 also has its place in professional broadcast work. It can be
used to adjust the pitch or even the gender of a person's voice and
still sound natural. Or use it to thicken up or harmonize a vocal track
for a jingle or commercial track. It's fun, colorful, easy to use,
economical and can be quite a useful source of unique effects and
sounds, if you're into this sort of thing! Apollo 440 used it for

Systems is a very rare British made drum machine circa 1981. It is
estimated that only 30 or so units were produced. It combines analog
synthesized drum sounds (Simmons style) and digital 8-bit sampled drum
sounds (LinnDrum style). There are seven voice cards, each with two drum
voices, for a total of 14 drum voices. Each drum voice can be switched
between either the analog (syn) or digital (real) mode and has its own
Volume and Pitch-Sustain control knobs.Its most obvious and unique feature is the computer-like interface. It
is used to facilitate graphic editing of the sequencing of drum
patterns, with data displayed on a monochrome CRT display (video can be
output to an external monitor via connections on the rear). Sequenced
patterns can be chained together into Songs. It does not offer graphic
drum sample editing or synthesis. New drum sounds can not be sampled in
to it either as it does not appear to have audio inputs. It does,
however, have extensive outputs including stereo out, individual outputs
for each voice, individual Trigger inputs and outputs for each voice,
Drum sync in and out, clock output, and cassette in and out for saving
data to tape.Two models are known to exist: the MK1 which may have been a two-piece
unit in which the monitor was separate from the rest of the machine, and
the MK2 (released in 1983) which integrated the CRT monitor and had an
orange (or black) case. In 1984, the MIDI specification was added to the
MK2, along with an additional 8-track sequencer, battery backed memory
and a floppy disk drive.Its most prominent user was David Stewart of the Eurythmics on tracks
such as ""Sweet Dreams"". However, it never sounded as good as
the competition surrounding it from Linn, Simmons and Oberheim and the
product never really took off. It has been owned/used by The
Eurythmics, Phil Collins, The Thompson Twins, Human League, Thomas
Dolby, Kajagoogoo, Japan, Willian Orbit, Chemical Brothers and Vince
Clarke. Supposedly, some of these artists used the same
machine as it passed from one group to the next.",

However, it is from that point onwards that the Drumstar begins to show signs of Elka's roots as an organ manufacturer. The unit features 20 separate rhythms (Disco, Latin, Cha Cha, etc...) each with 3 basic variations as well as a “Fill” and “Intro/Ending”, which brings us to user programming options which are restricted to a single programmable variation and fill per rhythm, which amounts to roughly 20 separate 2 bar sequences along with 20 separate 1 bar fills. Programming itself is accomplished via a tap write method, Hi Hatswith automatic quantize to 16th notes, which works extremely well despite the unusual drum trigger buttons. A further, frankly infuriating feature of the Drumstar is the inclusion of an internal cooling fan, doubtless to ensure reliable operation in a humid Mediterranean basement club in a late 80's summer but more than slightly annoying when attempting to use it within a recording situation where acoustics are all important. Clearly, this drum machine has a strong emphasis on live application.As with a number of the Drumstar's contemporaries of the period there is no editing of drum voices in any way and while the unit does feature MIDI it is unfortunately restricted to clock in and out alone, which is a real shame considering the limitations of the internal sequencer. The sound palette encapsulates all the sounds one might expect to find in a drum machine of this era, namely Kicks, Snares, Toms, Hand Claps, Hi Hats and Cymbals as well as a number of less common additions such as Electronic Snares (with a sound approaching a Simmons unit), Congas, Bongos, Triangles, Cabasa, Cowbell, Clave and even Agogo Bells and Guiro. It is not just the range of sounds but the subtle variations of those sounds that lend this drum machine an edge over it's competitor Hi Hats for example, rather than featuring simply a closed and open option, as the vast majority of units of this era did, features a muted closed hat, an accented closed hat, the open hat and a pedal hat sound. In combination, despite the fact that the unit features no shuffle or additional accent options, the machine can produce remarkably lively and active sequences.The sounds of the unit themselves are universally punchy and crisp, this is not a drum machine that you might describe as crunchy in the same way as you might a Casio RZ-1 yet it retains a great deal of character to its sounds that units such as the Roland TR-626 and later still the Alesis SR-16 perhaps lost in their quest for more realistic sounding units. Therefore, despite all the obvious flaws of the unit it is impossible to ignore the sounds it is capable of producing, which is ultimately the most important aspect of any instrument and accordingly it is on these sounds that the prospected user of the Drumstar will make their judgement.",

use of stable DCO's (digitally controlled analog oscillators) and
oscillator cross modulation of Pulse Width and a multimode filter made
it unique in its time.There is a cool joystick that replaces traditional pitch/mod wheels and
allows for greater variable real-time control over the two LFOs,
oscillator and filter modulation. The 6 sliders beside the joystick
assign what (LFO, osc and filter) goes to the joystick. Voices can also
be layered or split across the keyboard. Other great features include
the onboard digital Ring-Modulator, Chorus effect and Dual or Layer

host of features. Two of it's tracks can output MIDI data.This is just an extremely good analog and unique synth excellent for
pads, drones and glistening lead sounds. They're a bit of a pain to

Italian Organ maker Siel. In Europe it was known as the Siel Cruise. It was built when Sequential
was still a relatively small company and while they wanted to add a compact
mono+poly synth to their product-line, they didn't have the resources
yet to build one on their own.
It is actually two discrete synths in one—a ""Poly"" String section and a
""Mono"" analog synth section. There are even two individual outputs for
each section on the back. In all actuality, the Fugue is
the Siel Mono and Siel Orchestra synthesizers combined into one powerful instrument!The Poly section has full polyphony, like most of the polyphonic string synths of the era. It
is purely a Preset based String/Orchestra machine, with Piano, Strings, Brass and Organ presets. All
presets can be combined together for a richer sound with the
four push buttons (polyphony is not reduced when combined either). There is
also a ""Poly Effect"" section with a Chorus and VCF (filter) section.Then there is the Solo/Mono section. It is an
independent Mono Synth with a waveform section that includes 10 preset
waveforms and 10 variable waveforms. You can edit all 20 of the 
waveforms/presets to your liking. The sliders provide fast and easy
hands-on access to tweaking sounds while performing. The Solo/Mono mode
also has its own filter that can self-oscillate, with full VCF Envelope
ADSR, Frequency and Resonance sliders. There is 
a Vibrato slider control for use in the Solo mode. There is also a
Priority Left/Right control for the direction of note priority.The Fugue has many red and green lights for easy operation within the
sections...and it looks cool in the dark too. A nice joystick is used
for Pitch changes in the Mono synth section. But the true power behind this synthesizer is the
split keyboard function which gives you the
ability to play chords with your left hand while soloing with your
right hand (or vice/versa with a nice sounding bass-line). By layering
both sections you can create an interesting sound for solos or for
chords with the Mono synth taking priorities for Right or Left notes.
And you use a level slider control to split or layer the sections. It's
a fun synth that can easily create that classic disco-70's sound.",

even 6 VCF's! However this synth has too many limitations on basic
needs: cheap construction and parts; editing requires an external
software editor and a Commodore 64 (or Macintosh, see Patch Files
below); there are no real-time performance controls - not even pitch
bend or modulation wheels; too many presets (80) but far too few user
patches (20). The preset sounds consist of basic organ, string and brass
type sounds, but exploring this analog synth can lead to some cool
sounds. The VCF, VCA and VCO sections all have separate ADSR envelope
generators. The LFO can control the VCO, VCF or VCA. A nice touch are
the two separate on-board sequencers - sort of a Sequential tradition.For those of you who want to edit the sounds on the Max, you will need
Sequential's Model 920 software and an ancient Commodore 64 computer or
you can use Mark of the Unicorn's Unisyn software editor for Mac/PC (You
can even use modern MIDI controllers like the Oxygen-8). This is the
only means of editing sounds, without which you are stuck with the 80
presets and whatever may be in the 20 user patches. The sequencing specs
are dramatically enhanced by the Model 920 software as well, boosting
the note capacity from 500 notes to 3400. Strongly consider the Multi-Track or even the Six-Track before diving into the Max because it
simply does not compare with the programmability and ease of use as even
its closest relatives. It is used by Cirrus and Richard Barbieri.",

synth with sophisticated filters, envelopes, modulation capabilities and built-in sequencing.As was the developing trend around this time in the mid-eighties,
programming was being streamlined into using the buttons on the matrix
keypad to assign parameters to a rotary knob. (The only dedicated knobs
are for sequencer volume and speed, chorus depth and rate, master tune
and volume.) There are 99 memory patches for your analog sound
creations. It also features a nice arpeggiator with hold and transpose
functions. But lying at its heart is a sophisticated (for 1985) onboard
sequencer. It could store up to four polyphonic sequences with a
metronome, 1600 note memory, an overdubbing mode and quantizing
(autocorrect) functions, individual track volume and speed controls.
Sequences could be chained together and patches could be changed on the
fly. Sequences are recorded in real-time (no step-time modes here).Additional features include MIDI in/out, six separate audio ouptuts (one
for each voice) and a stereo output, built-in stereo chorus effect and a
5-octave keyboard with velocity sensitivity and split/layer modes (layer
up to six different patch sounds onto one note). With an original list
price of about $1,500, these days they can be found closer to $300 - a
great bargain for classic Sequential sounds with onboard sequencing and

inexpensive, monophonic analog synth! It has two VCOs, a great 4-pole
lowpass filter, two ADSR envelopes (one for filter), and a compact
three-octave keyboard. With a Pro-One, you can easily create punchy
analog bass-lines and leads or quirky analog synth effects.The Pro One is an extremely flexible synth with lots of modulation
possibilities (ie: the filter, VCO B and LFO can modulate VCO A or B
frequencies or pulse widths, or the VCF). There's also an onboard
sequencer, something common on many Sequential synths but not often
found on other monosynths of the time. It is very basic, however,
storing only two patterns and up to 40 notes max. Also, only pitch info
is recorded (and in step time only); you can not assign a note duration
to any notes. So it's basically a short melodic sketch-pad...but useful.

10 voices with 20 of Sequential's unique analog VCO oscillators at 2 per
voice for a big fat analog dream! The Version 1 series suffered from
major overheating and unstable tuning problems making it clumsy and
unreliable to use. It also had a standard 61 note keyboard and looked
just like the P5.Then came a bigger and better looking stacked keyboard version (as seen
above); to be known as Version 2. Better chips were designed which soon
cured most of the overheating problems. While Rev. 1 & 2 Prophets
used chips made by SSM (Solid State Microdevices) which were fatter
sounding but less stable, the Rev 3 Prophets changed to CEM (Curtis
Electronics Manufacturing) chips. These increased their stability and
reliability. Some audiophiles think they sound thinner than the SSM
chips. However tuning and other functions were still somewhat unstable.Version 3 (pictured top) was by far the best and most stable. 20
oscillators (2 per voice), 10 voices, 2 independent 61 note keyboards
and all the great sounds and editing facilities as the Prophet 5! Built in Tuning tones and Auto-Tuning
functions help make sure you won't go out of tune. And top notch
circuitry and design prevent overheating. Multiple keyboard modes allow
for true flexibility for different performance / voicing needs! The
Prophet 10 is a truly fat and classic analog instrument. Used throughout
the 1980's and on into the 90's by names like Tangerine dream, The

and a white noise generator. The analog filters, envelope and LFO all
sound great and are extremely flexible. The P5 had patch memory storage
as well, which scanned and memorized every knob setting for storing and

it has its fair share of analog synth problems such as unstable tuning,
it's difficult to repair, lacks MIDI, etc.There are basically three versions of the Prophet 5:Rev 1 P5s are pretty unreliable, if you find one; they're also
quite rare. These were all hand-assembled in the 'garage stage' of the
company.Rev 2 uses SSM chips, and has some differences in its control
logic capabilities from the final version. It can't be retrofitted for
MIDI, but is considered by most to be the better-sounding of the two
'common' P5s.Rev 3 is the final version, and subsequent Rev 3.1, Rev 3.2 and
Rev 3.3 each are capable of taking a MIDI retrofit. They're also capable
of microtonal tuning. The audio quality of the Rev 3 is different,
however, as it uses Curtis chips instead of Rev 2's SSMs; many people
think the Rev 3 units sound 'thinner'. The Rev 3, however, is considered
the most reliable of all of the different versions and they had 120

rich, creamy and wild making it an excellent stand-in for Moog-like
sounds. Also, the Six-Trak is capable of interesting and complex sound
effects, mostly thanks to useful cross modulation and the six
oscillators. It also includes a simple 6-channel on-board sequencer (of
little usefulness these days). Its biggest limitations were: shortest
attack too slow for really percussive sounds, smallest vco frequency
adjustment too big for Zawinul-style subtle frequency envelopes &
LFO, and the lack of built-in chorus, which would have helped to thicken
the rather thin sounds in Polyphonic mode. The SixTrak can be fun and

However, each drum sound has a much more flexible tune control than any other drum machine of its time, allowing you to change cymbals into gongs, for example. All sounds can also be layered, allowing for chord-like drum tones, tom rolls and all kinds of wacky sounds. You can also play its sounds in reverse and program the pan position and volume of each sound. Sounds on EPROM cartridges can add up to eight additional drum tones for different sounds. This machine is also MIDI equipped, able to transmit and receive all of its controller information including volume and tuning. TOM's sequencer allows you to record rhythm patterns in real time or step time. It can store up to 99 patterns and each pattern can be up to 99 measures! As many as 99 patterns can be linked to form Songs. Sequencer memory holds 2,300 notes, but factory updates were available to upgrade that to either 5,000 or 10,000 notes - something to be aware of if looking to buy one of these. The TOM's memory is also retained via internal battery backup when powered down - these batteries had a 5-year lifespan. Program memory could also be saved/loaded to casette tape. The TOM also featured an ""Improv Factor"" to create drum fills which can add variation to your patterns. TOM's ""Human Factor"" allowed you to program minor changes in the tuning and volume of your patterns for a 'humanzied' feel - before that term existed in the sequencing lexicon. The TOM also had a ""Reframe"" function that let you change the location of the down-beat in your pattern at the touch of a button. In its time, the TOM was very advanced for a drum machine. Its only let-down was the quality of its sounds, which are nowhere near as warm or nostalgic as the Roland TR-X0X machines or the Linn Drums.",

synthesizer, circa 1979. The concept is typical of its time - it offers
15 preset sounds (hence the P15 moniker) that sound almost nothing like
what they claim to emulate, with basic synthesizing capabilities when
switched into ""Manual"" mode, housed in a rugged road-worthy
case with built-in carrying handle and a latched cover.The P15 is monophonic and totally analog. Although it says ""Digital
System"" on the front panel, this only refers to the underlying
circuitry inside using some (at the time) modern integrated circuit chip
technologies in place of traditional transistor based technology for a
more stable result. The signal path is still entirely analog from start
to finish, and the result is very warm sounding.The 15 preset sounds offer some unique flavors not often seen before,
such as the Latin ""Vihuela"" and ""Panpipe""
instruments. However, most of the time users will prefer to use this
synth in ""Manual"" mode which allows you to use the independent
VCF and VCA sections. There is no oscillator section, however, when in
""Manual"" mode, the preset buttons can be used to select from
the available wave shapes stored in the preset locations. These range
from sawtooth and square waves to a mixture of others in various
octaves. There does not, however, appear to be a sine wave and there is
no noise generator.The self resonating VCF (filter) has the typical Frequency Cutoff and
Resonance controls. There are two basic envelopes - one for the VCA and
the other for the VCF -  each with Attack and Sustain controls. There is
no Decay or Release. There is one LFO with sine or square waveforms that
can modulate the VCF, VCA or VCO in varying amounts using the
""Wah-wah"", ""Tremolo"" and Vibrato
""Intensity"" sliders, respectively. The speed of the LFO can be
adjusted to a rate of almost self-oscillation. Finally, there is also a
""Glide"" (portamento) option.The attached YouTube videos will allow you to judge how the EKOsynth P15
sounds for yourself. But there is no denying that this is a rare and
unique Italian take on the Preset-based synthesizer format of the late
1970's. It's easy to understand, can be a pleasure to play with (if in
good condition) and with a construction of steel and wood wrapped in
vinyl, is built like a tank!",

in the USA that produced compact semi-modular synthesizers, primarily
for the educational market. At the time (late sixties, early seventies),
analog synthesizers were an electronic engineering wonder and
Universities seemed just as viable a market (if not, more so) than the
local corner music store. The first ""ElectroComp"" series instruments to
come from EML included the 100, 200 and
300.The ElectroComp 100 is a duophonic keyboard-equipped synthesizer (one
of the earliest polyphonics) designed to compete with the Minimoog and ARP
2600. But unlike Moog and ARP, who used transistors that would tend
to drift out of tune under various operating temperatures, EML used op
amps which proved to be far more stable and reliable. The 100 features
very clearly laid out controls with rotary knobs and most of its patch
points located along the top of the panel. It has four
oscillators—that's more than the Minimoog—and they featured continuously
variable waveform selection from a variety of sine, saw, square, and
pulse-width shapes. It has a multi-mode filter with low pass, band pass,
band reject and high pass modes. Two Attack/Decay/Sustain Envelope
Generators. White and pink noise generators. A ""Sampler"" section
provides sample-and-hold functions. Effects like Portamento. External
audio inputs to the oscillator mixer, filter and output mixer sections,
and control inputs for up to two keyboards and filter control.  The 100
could easily be closed, secured and carried inside its wood casing.Being among the first synthesizers from a relatively new company
meant that there were not a lot of 100 models produced, and therefor the
100 is very rare. The 100 was produced over a relatively short time
period, from 1970 to 1972, when it was replaced by the better-known ElectroComp 101. The 101 was in production
for a decade. Common sense would seem to dictate that the 100 was the
first model EML produced, followed by the 200 which appeared to be an expander system
for the 100. Perhaps this was the intention during the conception of
these models, however, the 200
apparently came first in 1969, immediately followed by the 100 in 1970.

(EML), a small synthesizer company based out of Connecticut in the USA.
Like the ARP 2600, the 101 was a patchable (1/4''
patch cords) semi-modular synth with a pre-wired voice path that could
be over-ridden via patching. But unlike the ARP (or Minimoog for that matter), the 101 had as
many as four oscillators (two of which could go sub-sonic, for use as
LFOs) with multiple waveforms that you could sweep between using its
rotary knobs. The 101 was also Duophonic so you could play up to two
notes at once. Another major distinction was that unlike Moog and ARP,
who used transistors that would tend to drift out of tune under various
operating temperatures, EML used op amps which proved to be far more
stable and reliable.Other onboard features included a voltage controlled 12 dB/oct
multi-mode filter with resonance, two envelope generators,
ring/amplitude modulator, noise, and sample-and-hold (they call this the
""Sampler""). In addition, the 101 makes no distinction between control
voltage and audio paths allowing just about any source to be patched to
any control or audio input in any order. The 101 could easily be closed,
secured and carried inside its wood casing.In its day, the 101, as most of EMLs instruments, were marketed and
sold to universities and other educational markets. But with the
4-oscillator architecture, multi-mode filter, and elaborate patch
control, the EML-101 was undoubtedly one of the most flexible of all of the
portable patch-synthesizers available at its time of manufacture. So it
did not take long for it to find its way into mainstream music. It has
been used by Skinny Puppy, Tommy Mars, Download, Weezer, Foreigner,
and Ohm.",

for producing synthesizers along the same lines of Moog and ARP, but
most EMLs were destined for the educational market. The ElectroComp 200
was one of EML's first synthesizers, introduced in 1969. It's old
school but has very sophisticated features for the time (such as a Wave Shaper and stereo sound). It is
monophonic and includes two oscillators, independent high- and low-pass
filters, two ring modulators, an LFO with sample-and-hold, stereo
panning, and built-in spring reverb. The front panel of the 200 is
nicely designed and laid out (they can be found in either silver or
blue, as seen here). There are 31 mad-scientist-looking knobs and over 60 patch
points! With a little patching, even people new to analog synths will be
able to start getting sounds out of the 200—it was originally intended
for use in educational institutions.Note however that the EML 200 is keyboard-less, making it more like
an Expander module designed to interface directly with other EML
equipment. Most notably, with the Model 300 manual controller which
offered a 4x4 key matrix, pitch knobs, and an oscillator with envelope
generator and VCA of its own. Today, you can use the 200 with analog
synths other than EML with the properly modified CV/Gate connections and
converters (its oscillators are a non-standard 1.20v/oct). The EML 200
today is most valuable as a collectors item rather than a piece of
studio kit, due mostly in part to its rarity in relation to the more
popular Moog and ARP instruments that it is comparable to, as well
as being surpassed by the more common ElectroComp 101.",

synthesizer/sequencer that first appeared in 1970 and although it was
produced until 1984, roughly 300 were made. The synthesizer (401)
component can be considered a scaled down version of the EML 500 in some ways. It looks very similar in
color and layout but lacks a built-in keyboard. It retains patch-cord
signal patching and editing associated with modular synths as well as
some switches. Dual VCOs produce a monophonic analog sound which can be
shaped by the multimode resonant VCF (filter) with switchable hi, low and
band pass filtering. Only sawtooth, square and noise waveforms are
available from the oscillators. The envelope section offers only attack
and release control (the EML 500 envelope
section added sustain).Complementing the EML 401 modular component is the 400 system which, as
seen above, is covered with dozens of switches and sliders. Basically
it's an analog sequencer component. It is a 12-tone diatonic sequencer
with a digitally controlled voltage quantizer built-in - a sophisticated
feature for the time. This allows for a variable number of
steps-per-octave ranging from 5 to 60...a very unusual feature which
makes the unit very useful for those exploring alternate/microtonal
tunings. It also offered voltage controlled envelope generators in 16
stages! These could be programmed for creating pretty wild sequences and
patterns.The EML 400 and 401 system was a response to the popular Moog and ARP
modulars from the era. It offered new ways of synthesizing classic
analog sounds which may not have been better than its competition, but
it certainly was unique. Today these rare instruments can still be found
in use by synth anoraks around the world.",

performance synthesizers set by the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey. The EML 500 is a monophonic analog
synthesizer with dual VCOs like the Odyssey does for a thick sound. Nice and
evenly distributed sliders and switches are laid out across the top of
the keyboard for easy access to all editable parameters. The era of the
knobs and patch cords of modulars like its bigger brother, the EML 101, as well as the classic ARP 2600 and Moog 3C
systems were coming to an end with the rise of these easier to use,
hard-wired, performance synthesizers.The dual VCOs offer
square, sawtooth and noise waveforms. There is a simple VCA envelope
section with controls for attack, decays and sustain (ADS). It also has
envelope repeat for drones. The VCF section is very nice and unique
sounding with switchable low-pass, band-pass and hi-pass filtering and
resonance. The LFO can generate some great modulation possibilities with
6-waveform shapes to choose from. Both the LFO and sample/hold or
track/hold is unique sounding as well and can modulate the oscillators,
filter, or VCA. Other features include ring modulation and amp
modulation, octave up/down switching, external audio inputs (to the VCF,
ring/amp mod and VCA), a sustain pedal input and CV/Gate external control.
It also has a controllable preamp stage built in. The audio input can
sound really nice too, it can be overdriven by feeding the signal back
into itself. It has a mixer section that can switch between external
input or noise. So you can mix in the amount of external input with the
two oscillators which each have their own mixer as well. Another unique
thing about this synth is that it has a scaling feature where you can
change the tuning scale between notes.In comparison to ARP and Moog, while it might borrow a little bit
from a cosmetic perspective (looks a bit like an Odyssey), internally
this was designed around op-amps, not transistors. This gives EMLs a
much different sound than pretty much anything else out there. Both the
ARP and the Moog sound more similar to each other than either does to
the EML. These were designed by industrial engineers (not musicians) who
brought a very different perspective on synth design to the table. The
EML has its own sound that can be described as archaic, “science lab”
sounding, and reminiscent of 60’s science fiction movies. In fact you
may be required to wear a white smock while operating this machinery!
The EML 500 is an elegant yet inexpensive alternative to similar
machines that will not let you down when it comes to sounds, flexibility,
programmability and uniqueness. It’s been used by DEVO—It’s the ""Whip-it""
sound!",

You can turn on or off any of the oscillators you wish, and no tuning is
necessary! The oscillators only generate square waves and though the
synth itself is monophonic, the SynKey is still one fat sounding synth.
Its new 'Second touch' is like Aftertouch which gives you filter sweeps,
vibrato and pitch bends by pressing harder on the key.The SynKey employed a truly unique form of program memory for supposedly
better on-stage use and hassle-free programming. Sounds that you create
are stored on plastic punch-cards. One sound or patch can be stored per
card and this includes most of its editable parameters. The SynKey
originally shipped with 25 blank cards and 25 pre-punched cards, which
were some EML factory sounds. So loading and storage of programs was
fast and easy. But without the cards... well, then you'll just have to
revert back to writing down your patch settings. There were two models
made, the programmable one pictured top (SynKey 2001), and a
non-programmable version pictured just above (SynkKey 1500). It has been

Dave Smith is considered a legendary figure in the
synthesizer world, he founded Sequential Circuits and designed such
classics as the Prophet 5 and 
Prophet VS, and he was a pioneer in bringing MIDI to
synthesizers. After a stint working in Software Synthesis for Seer
Systems, Dave collaborated with Roger Linn on the Adrenalinn, and then
officially came back to the world of hardware synthesizers. And the
world was happy to find him back designing synths for a new generation
of players - starting with Evolver!So, there's no keyboard on this thing! Well, it's a hands-on desktop
sound module and audio processor. The Evolver is a true analog
synthesizer that incorporates many of Dave and Sequential's old
secrets, circuits and technologies. It's monophonic
with four oscillators - two analog DCOs and two digital - it's a true
analog/digital hybrid synth. The analog oscillators feature multiple classic waveforms plus pulse-width
modulation and hard sync, and they sound really nice and big. The
digital oscillators feature FM synthesis, Ring Modulation and 96
wavetables straight out of the Prophet VS
(plus 32 user wavetables, loaded via MIDI software editors such as Motu
Unisyn). Evolver also features two Curtis voltage-controlled analog low-pass
filters which are fully resonant and switchable for two- or four-pole
operation, two digital highpass filters and real analog VCAs. Modulation
capabilities are handled by four LFOs and three ADSR envelope generators
(for the filter, the amp, and one is user assignable). There are dedicated
onboard effects (feedback, delay, distortion, glide, etc.). Stereo audio
inputs let you process external audio through the Evolver's filters,
envelopes, LFOs and effects.One of its coolest features is the MIDI-syncable 16-step, 4-parameter,
analog-style sequencer (with each patch able to store its own sequence) which
really brings the Evolver to life with animated evolving sounds. The
LFOs, step sequencer, and three separate delays can all be synced for
massive, rhythmic, time-based effects in stereo. As for programming and
tweaking all these functions, Evolver's easy-to-navigate matrix-style
interface allows for quick editing and real-time control of 8 parameters
simultaneously.A major unique feature of the Evolver is that although it is monophonic,
it has a true stereo signal path. The reason many things come in multiples of two
here is because each channel gets its own independent analog
oscillator, lowpass filter, highpass filter, VCA and effects. It's sort of
like two independent synths - one on the left and another on the right. This
allows for pretty nice stereo imaging effects not possible with most
other mono-monophonic synths. Some of the factory patches will make your
jaw drop - sometimes it's really hard to believe it has only a single
voice!It's no surprise the Evolver was a hit when it came out. There just are
no other modern analog-digital synthesizers in its price range, it
sounds wonderful, and is one of those synths that has no real need for
external effects or sweetening. Evolver literally is a rebirth of the
best of Sequential Circuits, updated to meet the needs of today's
musicians. The internal computer and DSP chips can be reprogrammed via
MIDI, for easy bug fixes, OS updates and feature additions. Other forms
of the Evolver that have evolved: Mono Evolver
(a keyboard version), Poly Evolver (a polyphonic
keyboard version), and Poly Evolver Rack (a
polyphonic rack module).",

The Mopho is a single voice from the mighty Prophet ’08 with the addition of one sub-oscillator per DCO. It offers a stereo output and an audio input for processing external sound through its fantastic Curtis lowpass filter. The Mopho's 2+2 oscillators, fully analog signal path, extensive modulation capabilities, and characteristic DSI lowpass filter makes big analog sound available at an astonishingly low price! The desktop module version includes dedicated knobs (detented encoders) for pitch, volume, program selection, filter, and basic envelope controls as well as four knobs that can be assigned to any other parameters the user chooses. The interface is somewhat limited, but easy to learn and navigate. To overcome this limitation, there is a free Mac/Win software editor included, and there are a few third-party software editors available as well. Additional features include four LFOs, a gated 16-step sequencer, three ADSR envelope generators and an arpeggiator. There is also a ""Push-It"" button which auditions patches, can step through a sequence or function as a tap-tempo button. The keyboard version adds a USB interface, as well as a 32 key (2.5 octave) semi-weighted keyboard with velocity and aftertouch. With much more front panel real estate available, far more parameters are immediately accessible via 25 knobs as opposed to the desktop version's 10. Pitch Bend & Mod Wheels and classic wooden end panels are nice additions too. Both versions include a prorietary Poly Chain socket which allows you to connect and control other Dave Smith Instruments synthesizers for expanded polyphony and a much bigger sound. This works particularly well with the Prophet '08, and the Tetra.The Mopho is an excellent choice for anyone looking for large, aggressive analog sound combined with extreme flexibility at a very low price. It's tempting to make the Pro-One comparison, but it's much more accurate to think of the Mopho as a descendant rather than a reproduction. It shares the same spirit and function, but has a soul and personality that is all its own.",

Evolver. Their flagship instrument, it's a four-voice synthesizer
(essentially four complete Evolvers) with a 5-octave keyboard, pitch and
mod wheels, and a ton of knobs and switches in a clean, clear, easy-to-navigate layout. It
can be a four-voice poly synth, four mono synths (each with its own
sequencer), or any combination in between. The Evolver series resurrects some of the oscillator,
filter and other component technologies from the classic Sequential
Circuits Prophet-VS and Pro-One synths. 
The Evolver was a huge hit the moment it appeared and
this is the super-hands-on-real-time-programmable-polyphonic version of
the little beast.Each voice is a complete Evolver with four oscillators per voice: two
analog and two digital - it's a true analog/digital hybrid synth. The analog oscillators feature multiple classic waveforms plus pulse-width
modulation and hard sync, and they sound really nice and big. The digital oscillators feature FM synthesis,
Ring Modulation and 96 Prophet VS
wavetables plus 32 user wavetables (loaded via MIDI only). Each voice
also features two Curtis voltage-controlled analog low-pass filters
which are fully resonant and switchable for two- or four-pole operation,
two digital highpass filters and real analog VCAs. Modulation
capabilities are handled by four LFOs and three ADSR envelope generators
(for the filter, the amp, and one is user assignable). There are dedicated
onboard effects (feedback, delay, distortion, glide, etc.). One of its
best features is the MIDI-syncable 16-step 4-parameter analog-style
sequencer (with each patch having its own sequence) which really brings
things to life with evolving sounds. The LFOs, step
sequencer, and three separate delays can all be synced for massive,
rhythmic, time-based effects in stereo. A major unique feature of the
Evolver is its true stereo signal path. For each Evolver voice, the left
and right channels get their own independent analog oscillator, lowpass
filter, highpass filter, VCA and effects. This allows for pretty nice
stereo imaging effects.The Poly Evolver essentially quadruples all those Evolver specs!
In Program mode, all four voices play the same sound. In Combo
mode, voices can be allocated however desired: stack all 4 for a huge
unison sound, split or layer the keyboard in any configuration, and/or
play one or all sequences at the same time. Each voice can also respond
to a different MIDI channel. Each voice has its own stereo output jacks
in addition to the mix output. Stereo audio input can be routed to 
any or all of the voices, enabling parallel audio processing of external 
stereo or mono signals. The output of one voice can be routed to the input 
of another for interesting double-processing effects. And multiple Poly 
Evolvers can be daisy-chained for increased polyphony!Full of hundreds of jaw-dropping preset patches, the Poly Evolver offers
four times the punch of the original Evolver. The Poly Evolver finally
answered prayers for a truly hands-on, programmable synthesizer version of
the Evolver, and Dave Smith went all out on this one. The keyboard is
semi-weighted with velocity and aftertouch, the wood end caps and
overall design make for a great, classic look. The Pitch/Mod wheels are
back-lit. With 77 endless-turn knobs and 59 switches, pretty much all
parameters are within easy reach. There is a Poly Evolver Rack version of
this keyboard, but where is the fun in that? Unless, of course, you ""Poly
Chain"" one or more Poly Evolver Rack models to a master Poly Evolver
keyboard for tons more polyphony and Evolver madness!
The Poly Evolver would soon be followed up by the much less expensive Mono Evolver, a
monophonic keyboard version of the original Evolver.",

It can be a four-voice poly synth, four mono synths (each with its own sequencer), or any combination in between. The Evolver series ressurects some of the oscillator, filter and other component technlogies from the classic Sequential Circuits Prophet-VS and Pro-One synths. The Evolver was a huge hit the moment it appeared and this Rack model is the first polyphonic version of the little beast. Each voice is a complete Evolver with four oscillators per voice: two analog and two digital - it's a true analog/digital hybrid synth. The analog oscillators feature multiple classic waveforms plus pulse-width modulation and hard sync, and they sound really nice and big. The digital oscillators feature FM synthesis, Ring Modulation and 96 Prophet VS wavetables plus 32 user wavetables (loaded via MIDI only). Each voice also features two Curtis voltage-controlled analog low-pass filters which are fully resonant and switchable for two- or four-pole operation, two digital highpass filters and real analog VCAs. Modulation capabilities are handled by four LFOs and three ADSR envelope generators (for the filter, the amp, and one is user assignable). There are dedicated onboard effects (feedback, delay, distortion, glide, etc.). One of its best features is the MIDI-syncable 16-step 4-parameter analog-style sequencer (with each patch having its own sequence) which really brings things to life with evolving sounds. The LFOs, step sequencer, and three separate delays can all be synced for massive, rhythmic, time-based effects in stereo. A major unique feature of the Evolver is its true stereo signal path. For each Evolver voice, the left and right channels get their own independent analog oscillator, lowpass filter, highpass filter, VCA and effects. This allows for pretty nice stereo imaging effects.The Poly Evolver Rack essentially quadruples all those Evolver specs! In Program mode, all four voices play the same sound. In Combo mode, voices can be allocated however desired: stack all 4 for a huge unison sound, split or layer the keyboard in any configuration, and/or play one or all sequences at the same time. Each voice can also respond to a different MIDI channel. Each voice has its own stereo output jacks in addition to the mix output. Stereo audio input can be routed to any or all of the voices, enabling parallel audio processing of external stereo or mono signals. The output of one voice can be routed to the input of another for interesting double-processing effects. And multiple Poly Evolvers can be daisy-chained for increased polyphony!Full of hundreds of jaw-dropping preset patches, the Poly Evolver Rack offers four times the punch of the original Evolver. But it's not intended for performance oriented synth tweakers. It's designed to sit in a studio, tethered to your computer-MIDI set-up. Fortunately, Poly Evolver Racks ship with the Soundtower editor/librarian for both Windows and Mac OS X, but other programs such as Motu Unisyn can also be used to access, edit and control all the parameters and features of the Poly Evolver Rack. If you are more of a knob fiddler, the Poly Evolver is a fully programmable 5-octave semi-weighted keyboard version of of the Rack model, with 77 endless-turn knobs and 59 switches. It's a fantastic synth but the Rack model gives you all the same sounds and power, without all the knobs and hands-on controls, at a much lower price.",

synthesizers, in a beautiful, modern and ultra-stable programmable analog synthesizer!
Building on the Poly Evolver keyboard, the Prophet '08 
offers eight voices of polyphony with a 100% analog signal path.
The look is spot-on! Brand new, the Prophet '08 already looks like it's a classic vintage 
piece of history. And its sound really does blow you away!Dave Smith is considered a legendary figure in the
synthesizer world, he founded Sequential Circuits and designed such
classics as the Prophet 5 and 
Prophet VS, and he was a pioneer in bringing MIDI to
synthesizers. The new for 2007 Prophet '08 brings back much of the
original technology from those old Prophets (like Curtis filters and analog oscillators),
updated of course, to meet today's musicians needs.While it doesn't sound exactly like an original P5, it does sound
and behave more like one than any other pretender. It's cleaner, purer
and a little more predictable than its 25 year old predecessors. Actually, it sounds just 
like the Poly Evolver, minus the digital oscillators. Regardless, the Prophet '08 is truly a modern day Prophet series synth.
Unlike many (Roland) synths that are attaching vintage model names to their current synths
even though they are almost nothing alike (Juno, SH, etc.), the 
Prophet '08 is the real-deal next generation version of its predecessors.
As DSI says, the Prophet '08 is the product of evolution, not nostalgia.
Of course, it includes features we now take for granted, like velocity and aftertouch.
Add to that performance features like an arpeggiator, gated step
sequencer, and the ability to split and layer sounds. The modulation
possibilities are much deeper than anything Sequential ever produced,
making it capable of producing sounds the ""classics"" simply could not.Prophet '08 Special EditionThe year 2008 marks 30 years of great Dave Smith-designed synthesizers.
To celebrate, DSI issued the Prophet '08 Special Edition. In
addition to the standard Prophet '08 features, the Special Edition
includes red lighted (pitch/bend) wheels, exotic leopard-wood end panels, and a
special commemorative overlay signed by Dave. It also includes
editor/librarian software and the ""Dave Smith: Synthesizer Pioneer"" DVD.
It costs about $500 more than the standard model.",

(2.95 kg)', 'Date Produced': '2011'}"," The Tempest from Dave Smith Instruments is a collaboration between Dave Smith and Roger Linn. Dave Smith is the mastermind behind the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, MIDI, and the current DSI range. Roger Linn is the brain behind the Akai MPC, the LinnDrum, and more current offerings like the AdrenaLinn filter FX units. What they came up with draws on the strengths of each to create a hybrid of drum machine and synthesizer. In fact, the Tempest can be seen as a drum machine, drum synthesizer, polyphonic synth, and an analog groove-box—all in one desktop unit. The Tempest includes samples of classic drum machines and acoustic kits. But getting your money's worth really means digging into the analog synth engine where you'll find everything from classic sounds to radically different new sounds. Unlike classic analog drum machines, the user is not limited to a narrow range of basic editable parameters like pitch and decay. The Tempest is a full-blown synthesizer, so each drum sound can be anything from a traditional percussive sound (like a clap) to a soft analog synth pad. With 32 sounds available at a time (accessible through the 16 pads in two banks), the only limit is its six voices of polyphony. There have been hints at the possibility of allowing user samples, but no concrete announcements have been made as of this writing.Taking a look at the synth engine, anyone who has used another DSI synth will recognize a similar structure: classic subtractive synthesis with a deep mod matrix. Each of the six voices has two analog oscillators (DCOs) and two digital oscillators, producing Prophet '08 waveforms and drum samples, respectively. The Curtis analog low pass filter can be set to 12 or 24 dB/oct, allowing for classic 80's sounds but also tones that hint at the 70's. The high pass filter is also extremely effective in shaping the tone. Taking things even further, the Tempest offers two LFOs, five ADSR envelopes, two hardwired to the VCA and low-pass filter, the others freely assignable. To add even more versatility, no fewer than eight modulation paths are provided.But the emphasis here is on beats. The 16 pressure and velocity sensitive pads can be used in four different modes: 16 Beats to select different drum patterns, 16 Sounds to edit each sound patch assigned to the pad, 16 Time Steps for sequencing, and 16 Mutes to silence individual parts in real-time. Recording patterns can be done via the pads or with an external MIDI controller, which is especially useful for synth pads or melodic lines (although with the current OS 1.2.0.8 it's only possible to record one note at a time). The Roll button (a stutter effect with assignable ratio) and Reverse (for reverse envelopes that provide convincing backwards tape effects) provide for dynamic patterns. Both can be triggered in real-time.For even more real-time control, there are two assignable ""FX"" slide controllers that can be assigned to four different parameters per project—not just for effects but also parameters like pitch, resonance, pan, oscillator volume, LFO amount, etc. Available for use on one sound or the whole beat, they can be used in latching or non-latching mode. The slider movements can also be recorded for a single sound pad but not the whole beat.For those used to all-digital groove-boxes, the effects provided might seem meager. But Roger and Dave wanted to keep the unit's path analog so no digital reverb or other effects were added. With the choice of stereo or six individual voice outputs to feed into effects units, they have provided a lot of flexibility to how the user can feed the voices into their own effects boxes. The effects that are on board, however, are quite useful. The compressor does a great job at tightening up the sound, even if it does add a bit of analog hiss (some might just like that). The Distortion can add a bit of grit or a lot of harmonic squelching—but is all analog for some aggressive richness. Finally, there is Delay, which is a MIDI delay, as opposed to a digital or analog circuit. So the audio signal is not being delayed; MIDI is repeating the notes. Those expecting a traditional delay will probably be disappointed, but MIDI delay can be its own unique effect and can be useful for rhythmic effects.The layout is straightforward and the amount of knobs on the control panel provide easy access to real-time control. The knobs feel solid and the sliders are easy to master. The only thing that might slow down real-time performance is the Shift button. One is provided at the top left and another below the display. Pushing Shift changes the function of many of the knobs and some of the buttons. These dual-function knobs and buttons are ones that are less likely to be used in performance, but players who might want to adjust the Pan and Delay Repeat parameters in real-time, as an example, will have to remember to use the Shift button. Obviously, it's there to maximize the use of real estate, but it does take getting used to. It also takes time to remember where the buttons are—not unusual for a feature-packed unit, but their size and the font size can make finding the right button difficult in dim lighting, especially while trying to toggle the Shift button in addition to another button or knob. The OLED display screen is a tad on the small side but reads clearly. It shows a graphic display while programming of things like the ADSR envelopes, oscillator pitch, pulse wave shape, or the names of the sounds assigned to each pad, etc. It also shows the values of parameters like the attack or LFO rate while adjusting them, so it helps users dial in precise changes. More complex parameters like the modulation assignments require a bit of menu diving, as is to be expected, but it's pretty difficult to get lost. However, a firm grasp of synthesizer architecture will be valuable in creating new sounds and navigating the menus to make the most of the programmability. Loading up a project gives you 16 beats or patterns to choose from. You can use those to line up individual beats or combine those patterns to create songs. Unlike many groove-boxes, however, there is no ""Song"" mode. The emphasis is on real-time control rather than pre-programmed MIDI sequencing. Loading projects or beats is the only workflow on the device that seems a bit lacking. For a machine built with an eye on performance, scrolling through menus to get to the next project seems a bit slow. But once in the project, the user can easily select the individual patterns with the pads. Unlike many groove-boxes, there are no ""kits"" to choose from either. The user is free to choose from or create any sound and assign it to any of the 32 slots.Last but definitely not least, the Tempest has its own sound. Whether using the samples or the analog oscillators, the sound can definitely bring back the 80's, whether it's clean dance-floor beats or dirty underground rhythms. But it can also go places that no vintage drum machine could—glitchy clicks, thick bass lines, icy pads and more. The sounds will be familiar to those who have used other DSI synths. The depth of programming options make the Tempest both a robust analog drum-synth and poly-synth. Roger Linn is known as the king of swing when it comes to drum machines, and the Tempest is no different. In addition to the fine swing implementation, the latest OS also allows for odd time signatures, making this a truly unique analog drum machine experience.",

sits somewhere between their Prophet '08
poly-synth and its monophonic desktop module counterpart, the
Mopho. In fact, other than the new Prophet '08
themed paint scheme and knobs, the Tetra's case and layout is virtually
identical to the Mopho. What the Tetra offers is four-voice polyphony
and multitimbral capability using the same acclaimed analog technology
of the Prophet '08. It is essentially four Mopho's in one, or a mini
Prophet sound module.The Tetra is state of the art, but features a 100% analog signal path.
Its voice architecture is based on the Prophet '08, with two digitally
controlled analog oscillators per voice, but with the addition of
sub-octave generators for each oscillator. There's a resonant lowpass
filter utilizing classic Curtis chips with switchable 2- or 4-pole
modes, three DADSR envelope generators, four LFOs, an arpeggiator, and a
16 x 4 analog-style step sequencer (per voice). There are also over 20
different modulation sources and over 40 modulation destinations, as
well as a noise generator.The on-board controls are minimal yet functional. The most important
""tweak"" knobs are here: Filter Cutoff, Resonance, Attack and
Decay/Release. Proving that Dave Smith knows how musicians like to use
his instruments, the Cutoff and Resonance knobs are real potentiometers,
while all the rest are detent rotary encoders (the Mopho only uses
detent encoders). This means you get smooth filter sweeps when turning
them, rather than stepped changes, which is especially crucial for slow
gradual moves. An additional four assignable parameter controls are
front-and-center and can be assigned to affect any other parameters per
patch. Although all parameters of the Tetra can be controlled from the
minimal front panel, a free Mac/Win patch editor is also available to
really dig in deeper for serious synthesizing.The ""Push It! Push It!"" button is sort of a novelty, but cool
nonetheless. Pushing it is a way to audition the current patch. If the
patch has sequence data, the Push It! button will trigger the sequence
to start/stop. In addition, LEDs around the Push It! button labeled 1
through 4 will light up to indicate which of the four voices are being
used (whether you are triggering sounds from the Push It! button or from
MIDI/USB controllers).Tetra has three operational modes: Program, Combo, and Multi. In Program
Mode, the Tetra is a four-voice polyphonic synthesizer with four banks
of 128 programs. As with the Prophet '08, each program contains two
layers—each layer is essentially a separate patch—that can
be used to create keyboard splits or stacked sounds. Banks 1 and 2 are
the Prophet '08 factory programs; banks 3 and 4 are a combination of
Mopho and new programs. In Combo Mode a different program can be
assigned to each of the four voices. Use it to create 8-oscillator thick
unison patches, or diverse complex patches, or highly animated cycling
patches that  trigger up to four different sequences (remember each
voice can have its own sequence). In Multi Mode, the Tetra can be used
as a multitimbral sound module capable of playing up to four monophonic
parts on four MIDI channels, with separate outputs for each voice.The Tetra has some serious I/O for such a small package. There are four
outputs: mono, stereo, or per voice. There's also a headphones output.
MIDI In and Out/Thru ports, plus the Tetra is the first DSI model with
USB 2.0 for direct connection to your computer or DAW. Finally a
dedicated MIDI output called Poly Chain allows the Tetra to be chained
to other Tetras, Mophos, or Prophet '08s for increasing the polyphony of
your DSI instruments. Up to four Tetras can be poly chained to each
other (16 voices), or two Tetras can be poly chained to the Prophet '08
(16 voices), or one Mopho can be poly chained (5 voices). Also of note,
the Prophet '08s front panel controls map directly to almost all of
Tetra's parameters when poly chained. Alas, there is no audio input
available (something the Mopho does offer).The Tetra—four Mophos in one, four-voice poly synth, four part
multitimbral synth with individual outs, Prophet '08 expander, or
mini-Prophet '08—the Tetra is a big synth in a little package. It
is a real analog subtractive synthesizer with all the modern features
you would expect in the 21st century. If the Prophet '08 is outside your
price range, or maybe you feel the mono-synth trend embraced by the
Mopho is unnecessarily limiting in this day and age, then the Tetra
should surely fill that sweet spot in between. It has been used by
Morgan Page and Radiohead.",

you build it yourself (DIY). So in addition to offering quite nice analog sounds,
it gives you a chance to delve into synthesizer construction, and this can
really help you learn more about how these things work. It can be built
in about a day. Although it was first released in 1992, it is a true analog instrument
and is still currently available and manufactured.It is a small monophonic analog synth with two oscillators, 18 rotary
knobs, 3 switches and NO keyboard. There is a low-pass resonant A(S)R filter, an
ADSR VCA and portamento. It is quite affordable since you
have to build it yourself. The kit comes with most of the components and
detailed instructions so that anyone with a little soldering
experience could put one together successfully.There are two versions, a rack-mount or a desktop module. All of the
components and specifications are the same for both. 
It's capable of producing some pretty quirky
analog sounds and basslines but the number of different sounds you will
get out of this synthesizer is limited. There is MIDI on-board, albeit
very simple and basic. The FatMan uses control voltages to operate so
the MIDI is really a MIDI-to-CV converter. However, it does not transmit MIDI info
from it's knobs, though it's CV outputs can be used to control other old
analog gear you may have around. Still this is one basic synth, with no
effects, no arpeggiator or sequencer and no patch memory storage. But the DIY aspect
is novel and the finished product is well-worth the effort!",

machine. At the time it was released in 1978, it was the largest kit to
come out of PAiA. It was also the first PAiA kit to come pre-assembled
as an alternative option to building one yourself. The advantages of the
PAiA kit products were cost-effectiveness. Pre-assembled or DIY, the
parts were often inexpensive and you could get a fairly decent
instrument for much less money than by going for a traditional
commercial brand.It's a pretty simple and straightforward affair. There are two tonal
voicings (Strings and Piano) that can be played individually or
together. The Piano sounds a lot more like a harpsichord, however. The
Strings also sound a lot like the Piano sound, but with a much softer
attack and a built-in chorusing effect for a thicker and shimmering
sound. Both voicings are built on pulse-width waveforms only. Still, it
is pure analog circuitry and the 3-octave keyboard is fully polyphonic.The modulation and shaping capabilities of the Stringz ’n’ Thingz are
minimal. Essentially there are only Modulation and Sustain controls. The
Modulation is a simple LFO with Rate and Depth that modulates only the
String section of the machine. The Sustain controls allow you to adjust
the length of the release envelope for the Piano and String voices
individually. Sustain jacks allow the release to be controlled via foot
switches, pedals or control voltages. There is a keyboard split option
in which you can split the lower Strings (Cello) from the higher Strings
(Violin), and they can be assigned to either side of the split.It's housed in a rugged flight case, with a cover that can latch shut
for life on the road. The 1551 model offered a stereo output, but is
less common than the 1550 model. As with any vintage DIY kit, build
quality is of utmost concern. All in all, it's a fun toy, but not really

DJ Pure, and the Chemical Brothers.The FilterQueen is a 2-unit half-rack design with just a few knobs and
buttons and is most likely suited for DJs and easy-access live use. It's
still a stereo analog filter with switchable notch, band, low and
highpass filtering, envelope follower, LFO and the Momentary button.
There's also a large bypass (""Engage"") switch. The knobs control the
filter cutoff, resonance, LFO speed, depth and more. There is no MIDI,
no patch storage, no external audio input or gain controls. The EQ
Killer is another 2-unit half-rack design for DJs and performers. It's
basically three independent bandpass filters which can be used to filter
out or isolate certain frequency ranges of music. These sold for about
$300 each.",

It is also their
6th product in a series of outstanding and beautiful rack-mount processors.
Repeater uses cutting edge DSP technology with MIDI sequencer style
control over your audio loops by offering independent, real-time manipulation
over tempo, key and track offset. Repeater is not your ordinary sampler. It truly is a digital delay unit. You can
trigger it in various ways to record any audio source for any amount of time
you choose (up to 50 minutes of record time via CompactFlash media). The recording
repeats as a loop synced to a tempo. You can overdub additional sounds to
arrange and mix layers of loops and you can tweak each loop-recording in real time.
Loops can also sync to MIDI clock or to Audio Beat Detection. This makes the Repeater
perfect not just for musicians, but DJs too! Changing the Tempo will adjust the samples
and loops without degrading the sound quality!In the Project Studio, musicians may find the Repeater useful as a scratchpad. Play some chords into it,
overdub a bassline, then jam along! It may also be useful for creating delay effects
to a mix with unprecedented control. The DJ may find the Repeater great for sampling a loop
off a record using the Audio Beats Detect mode to match the tempo, and then replaying 
that loop over another section of that song or over an entirely new record to create 
entirely new ways of mixing! It is used by Richie Hawtin and Imogen Heap.",

production suite for PC. FL Studio is a pattern based sequencer, which  means you create your
songs in pieces (patterns) using the Step  Sequencer and the Piano Roll
view and  then weld those pieces together using the Playlist window (the
Playlist also supports full-featured audio tracks with hard-drive
streaming).  Then you can add a wide range of effects to your
instruments (reverb, phaser, flanger etc.) and  route the resulting
mixer tracks in any way you like to create complex mixing chains with
ease. The resulting  song or loop can be exported to a WAV/MP3 file and
all MIDI events can be exported to a standard MIDI file.Here is a brief review of the history of FL Studio (formerly Fruityloops):FL Studio (formerly FruityLoops) for the PC has been called the ReBirth killer, and with good reason. At first
glance it looks like a software-based Drum Machine, but look a little
closer. It functions like a drum machine because it is a pattern based
sequencer, just like Rebirth. However, more than just drum sounds can be
assigned to each 'channel'. Loops, bass, synth sounds, effect sounds and
samples can all be assigned to an unlimited number of 'channels'.
Creating patterns is as simple as in ReBirth or any drum machine in
which you set a tempo, start the loop and punch in your sounds.The reason one might consider FL Studio a ReBirth killer is that it
offers plenty more edit-ability of individual sounds and is more
programmable than the latter. In addition to panning, volume, pitch and
mix controls you'll find effects, envelope, resonance, cutoff, cut,
reverse and more! FL Studio also sports the new TS-404 synth section to
rival that ReBirth 303 sound. It also supports plug-ins, skins, external
MIDI control and up to 64 notes per pattern.Some additional features include an integrated BeatSlicer, live wheel
recording of all wheels, unlimited number of channels (not just 8),
support for 8 (VST&DX) FX tracks, integrated sample browser, cool
effects to alter the samples, playlist allowing to mix several patterns,
it can now act as master clock for sync, sends start / stop / clock /
SPP. If you loved ReBirth, you'll certainly be interested in FL Studio.
With it you can make ultimately more unique and different sounding
music, rather than something that sounds like it was made on a ReBirth!
FL Studio is being used by Mike Oldfield, Hellfish, Dan Hekate,
Somatic Responses, Heretik, and Sonic Belligeranza.Version 2.7 of FruityLoops offers: Integrated Beatslicer editor; Updated

quality instrument capable of fun and funky analog sounds. It really is black
and yellow too, just like the insect it is named after. Probably its most
distinguishing feature is the 2-octave keyboard which uses non-moving
touch-sensitive keys. The flat little keys are sensitive only to your
electro-static touch. It's a nifty technology for 1978, but in reality they
are unreliable and difficult to play. Other unique touches include a little
speaker built-in to the synth and EDP's own pre-MIDI connector ports for
linking it to other Wasps and EDP gear.A look under the hood, however, reveals some nice surprises. The WASP is
monophonic and powered by two digital oscillators supported by analog filters,
envelopes and controls. This makes it one of the earliest compact
digital/analog hybrid mono-synths, and it sounds great! The Wasp offers
flexible subtractive synthesis. It's pretty easy to dial up some cool bass,
synth, and other classic monophonic sounds. Its designer, Chris Hugget, also
designed the Oxford Synthesizer Company's venerable OSCar Synthesizer. The Wasp has been used by 808
State, Dave Holmes, Vince Clarke, Nick Rhodes (Duran Duran), WhiteHouse and
Add N to (X).The Wasp DeluxeLater versions of the Wasp included the Wasp Deluxe (released 1979) which
had all the features of the original plus a standard 3-octave keyboard, wood
panels, an oscillator mixer, an external audio-input, a larger built-in
speaker, and battery operation. It was definitely redesigned for the practical
musician. There was also the Wasp Special (released 1981) which also came with
wood panels, a black and gold color scheme, and an internal power supply, but
no built-in speaker and a return to the 2-octave touch-sensitive keyboard
design. EDP also produced a heavily modified Wasp that was built into a
guitar-form called the Keytar. It had a 2-octave keyboard with transpose and
portamento buttons on the neck. However, only two Keytars were ever made as
far as we know.The Wasp SpecialThe rest of EDP's wild world of synthesis includes the Spider, a 252-note step, or 84-note real time
digital sequencer designed to control the Wasp. The Caterpillar which is a 3-octave master keyboard
for controlling up to four inter-connected Wasps played polyphonically. The Gnat which is a smaller, single-oscillator version of
the Wasp that could also be linked to another Wasp to form a makeshift
triple-oscillator synth playable from either keyboard (the Gnat also came in
three versions similar to the Standard, Special and Deluxe models of the
Wasp). All EDP instruments could be inter-connected via their own pre-MIDI
style connection interface. While the Wasp and it's fellow insects may seem
quirky and even toy-like, their sound, technology, flexibility and portability
make them surprisingly good instruments that can still be found in use
today.",

is a top of the line 32-bit software VST-Sampler for Mac/PC. It integrates an
affordable, fully programmable digital sampler with your VST host applications. Because of
this, HALion is a sampler with almost no limits! You get up to 256 voices of polyphony
and 16 MIDI channel multitimbrality! HALion loads WAV, AIFF, Akai, E-mu, Soundfonts, ReCycle's REX, and LM 4/9 sample
formats. You can load samples (it ships with tons to get you started) but you can not record your
own samples directly (you can record sounds into your computer by other means, and store it as AIFF or WAV to load
into HALion). Sample memory is limited only by your computer's hard drives! HALion plays samples
by loading only the attack into RAM and streaming the rest from disk. This gives a lightning fast 
initial response and allows for more samples to be loaded into memory at any time.HALion has everything you'd expect from any hardware sampler and more. There is course/fine tuning, octave, glides, LFOs,
sample quality, and a scrollable virtual keyboard. It has 12/24 dB filters which include
notch, high, low, and band pass with resonance. Yet, even with the added Fatness switch, the filters are not really all that fat...but
they do alright. There are two 8-stage envelope generators for very dynamic
samples...great for textures, ambiences, pads and effects! Modulation possibilities are pretty good.
There are 12 modulation sources including LFO1, LFO2, velocity, pitch wheel, mod wheel, 
aftertouch, 4 assignable MIDI controllers and more. These can be assigned to control the filter cut-off, resonance,
volume, pan, pitch, and more. HALion is simply great! You may find using your computer to edit samples is much better than
your old hardware Akai or E-mu. Drag and drop samples across the keys as you wish and edit away! 
Easily set key zones, layer samples onto the same keys and use HALion's velocity cross-fading
so that the harder you play a key, the more the other sample layer is heard! Easily set the start
and end points of a sample, define loop points and more. Store any number of samples into a Program,
up to 128 Programs can be stored in a Bank. Each program can be assigned to a MIDI channel (1-16)
and to any of the 12 virtual outputs. Programs can be saved within your sequences for instant accessibility!
No more messing around with loading disks into your old hardware samplers!
In this age of VST and software synthesis, it's nice to see a widely compatible, user friendly, feature rich, and pro-quality
sampler hit the market.  HALion String Edition from Steinberg/Wizoo features sections of 8
double basses, 10 cellos, 12 violas and 16 violins, with full control
over articulations such as crescendo, bowing or portamento. Each section
is provided in two versions you can combine freely with other sections.

classic Linn LM-series Drum Machines left off. The LM-4 is a VST
instrument for applications such as Cubase VST. 
There are no messy MIDI or audio cables, yet it is completely Midi
enabled, automated, and its audio outputs are routed
directly into the VST host's internal audio mixer, ready for adding EQ and
effects. The LM-4 features 20 Drum Kits with at least 18 drum sounds in each kit.
The sounds are great! From classic to electro and retro!
Ten kits were produced by the well known (:wizoo:) sound designers.
You can also create your own drum sounds using 16 or 24 bit AIFF
or WAVE files - essentially making the LM-4 a sequencing sampler plug-in!
In addition, the LM-4 boasts that its timing is measurably better than 
any other MIDI controlled device!
The LM-4 also features Polyphonic Drum Pads, automated tunings and levels
of individual drum sounds and both stereo and 4 individual outputs.
Finally, up to eight LM-4s can be layered and synced (depending on RAM and CPU)
for elaborate percussion and music creation!LM-4 Mark IIThe LM-4 Mark II 32 Bit VST drum module released in 2002 builds
upon the original to give you more flexibility and better sounds! The
Mark II comes with a huge range of high-quality 24 Bit drum and
percussion sounds that cover the most diverse music styles from Latin
and Rock to House, Electro and Drum'n'Bass. The Mark II's enhancements
include over 1GB of samples, 50 drum kits, drag and drop audio files, 20
velocity layers per pad, ADSR envelopes, Bit Crusher and Reverse, 12
outputs (3 stereo and 6 mono), volume, pan, and pitch automation. It
also offers 16-, 24- or even 32- bit AIFF, WAVE or SD II (Mac only)
compatibility. The LM-4 Mark II XXL is the LM-4 Mark II bundled with 70
additional high-resolution kits.",

Model D Minimoog, capable of the same
fat 3-VCO monophonic bass sounds of the Mini. But because the Model E is
a software plug-in you get many more advantages over the real deal. To
start, you have MIDI, unlimited storage for your created sounds,
super-stable tuning, a warm filter and oscillators with crisp, clear
sounds. Of course you are no longer limited to monophonic sounds, the
Model E has 64 voice polyphony and 16 multitimbral parts. And the
Plug-In comes at a fraction of the price and weight of a real Moog
synthesizer! Cubase's MIDI tracks are routed directly to the input of
Model E. outputs appear directly in the VST mixer, so effects and EQ can
be applied just like any audio channel. All Model E settings are
automatically saved with your song files and the final mix can be
streamed out to an audio file.But among all these new features the look and basic design concept
remains true to the original Minimoog. Three oscillators per voice, a
great 24dB filter with ADS and no LFO. And its sounds are just as
authentic. Being digital, it's expected that they should lack some of
the 'oomph' of an analog Minimoog. But they impressively cover the gamut
of Minimoog bass sounds. From low heavy bass to nasal whistle-y sounds
from HipHop and R&B to Techno. Other features include Mono-Mode and
a Glide or portamento type effect. Up to 8 Model E's can independently
be used as VST Instruments in a song.. it's like having 8 Minimoogs at
your fingertips! At its low price, getting the Model E plug-in is a
no-brainer for any Cubase VST user who has ever dreamed of using the
Minimoog. It is used by Hans Zimmer.",

Grand Piano in the self-contained, pristine environment of your computer.
Its sounds are based on the sampled/modeled sounds of a real Grand Piano. As a
result it takes up over 1.3 GB of disk space! It also uses a large chunk
of RAM (you can adjust how much sample is streamed from disk or loaded
into RAM). If you want that real piano sound instantly accessible and
flexible enough to use in your computer sequencer, The Grand is an
affordable good deal! It is available for both Mac and PC platforms with VST 2.0
compatible host applications.The initial screen you see when you open an instance of The Grand is of
the keyboard. You can click on the keys to play notes (or use MIDI
instruments connected to your computer). The Grand's 88-key keyboard
emulates many of the characteristics of an acoustic piano. There are
three weighted key settings to choose from and adjustable velocity
curves individually adaptable to suit your personal playing style.
Authentic functionality of sustain and sostenuto pedals is also built-in
with real re-pedaling resonance.There are a couple options for shaping your Grand Piano sounds. There are
four basic Piano sounds: Natural, Soft, Bright, and Hard. A simple
Ambience effect can be dialed-in, adding a little reverb to sweeten' the
sound. There are also hammer and string release parameters for
authentic-sounding damper and hammer action, adjustable polyphony and
tuning, tempered and grand concert piano tunings. The Grand succeeds in
creating a darn good piano, rich in sound and with enough
editability to give you a broad range of feeling. Unfortunately,
The Grand does not attempt to go beyond emulating the piano sound, so
there are no LFOs, no filters, nothing that can really modulate or
change the sound. Just rich, clean piano sounds instantly available and
with simple programmability. It's a great tool for composers who don't
want to deal with the troubles and expense of a real concert grand,
and it's easier to use than any sampler.",

from Oxford Synthesiser Company - the OSCar. The OSCar is a much
sought-after vintage mono/duophonic synthesizer that was among the first
to use digitally controlled dual oscillators and offer plenty of
programmability and warm analog sounds great for bass, lead, pads, efx,
and so much more!The impOSCar is a great software plug-in available as a VST instrument
for Mac and PC, as well as an Audio Unit plug-in for Mac OS X. Although
it's not without its glitches and bugs, it is a beautiful plug-in that
accurately reproduces the original's look and lush analog sound while
adding a few major enhancements of its own. This plug-in is a must have
soft-synth for its ease of use and awesome sound.Like the original it features two independent oscillators each with
multiple waveforms including user waveforms - you can create your own
via Programmable Additive Wave Matrix (left of the keyboard)! The
original offered mono and duophonic modes, and the impOSCar adds 4-, 8-,
and 16-voice modes as well! The filters have been replicated and
enhanced as well, providing additional filter modes while maintaining a
warm and smooth sound very much like the original. The flexible LFO
section now has MIDI sync options and more too.A new effects section offers stereo Chorus and Delay (with MIDI sync) to
really warm and liven' up your sounds. The Delay has independent
feedback, delay-time and wet/dry mix control for the left and right for
really cool stereo delay effects! The stereo delay also features
separate high and low pass filters, adjustable delay units-per-beat, and
gate amount. Most of these controls are concealed under the impOSCar
logo, which is easily accessed by just a single mouse-click.
Additionally there are now programmable Velocity Response controls added
to the keyboard (which can be shifted up and down over a 5-octave
range). Additional features include a mono, duo and polyphonic
arpeggiator with four modes and a portamento with six modes. Like any
quality soft-synth, every control can be assigned to a MIDI controller
via MIDI Learn with storable CC maps.While the original had some patch memory storage, the impOSCar has
unlimited storage, and your patches can be saved with your sequences. It
ships with over 500 patches created by artists from Ultravox,
S-Express, Underworld, Basement Jaxx, Terminalhead, and Republica and
you can load original OSCar patches via SysEx format. Other users of the
original include Hardfloor, Orbital, Ozric Tentacles, Jean-Michel
Jarre, Asia, Stevie Wonder, BT, Sneaker Pimps and Keith Emerson. The
impOSCar is simply the best way to get your hands on this venerable
classic. BT says the impOSCar is, ""quite simply, the best softsynth

of the Mellotron keyboards. The Mellotron was a rather large keyboard that
used tape loops of recorded acoustic instruments to generate it sounds.
The Mellotron was famous for its warm and characteristic flute and string
sounds especially, and also other choirs and brass sounds. One of the most
notable appearances of the Mellotron was in the Beatles' ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".The M-Tron recreates this classic sound. It contains 28 classic tape banks 
including strings, choirs, flutes, brass, and some rhythms. Only one tape bank can
be played at a time, but opening up additional M-Tron VST instruments allows you
to layer different Mellotron sounds or create an ensemble! New to the Mellotron
experience is the addition of two simple envelope controls: attack and release.
Otherwise, the M-Tron makes a faithful recreation of the original
white box. To truly recreate the sound of the Mellotron, Gmedia sampled
each tape individually for each key on the keyboard. These samples are 16-bit and monaural, recorded
from various actual Mellotrons, including Radiohead's Mellotron M400.On the original Mellotron, the tape played for about eight seconds and stopped without looping. 
This led to inconsistencies in pitch
and timbre and it is truly lo-fi by today's standards. It also made playing the Mellotron a tricky
skill to master. These qualities could have easily been rectified in this new
VST version, however Gmedia remained faithful to the original and maintains the 
unique lo-fi characteristics. Some modest enhancements have been made however, to 
bring the Mellotron a little more up to date. MIDI is fully implemented, with control 
over volume, pitch, tone, envelope attack and release. A vintage Mellotron is a rare instrument to find, and an expensive one at that ($5,000+). 
M-Tron is an incredibly inexpensive way to get your hands on the closest thing
to a real Mellotron (those brown rings you see above the keyboard in M-Tron's panel are simulated coffee stains,
probably from the previous owner...). It looks and sounds just like the original, but is much
cheaper and a thousand times easier to maintain - just load it up into your VST
program and revisit the sounds of the sixties and seventies!Check out the snazzy packaging for the M-Tron program. Just like the real thing...but better!",

original instrument's circuitry and design in this software synth plug-in
available as a VST instrument for Mac and Windows/PC as well as an Audio
Unit version for Mac OS X. While capturing the character of the original
it adds some necessary enhancements that make the sounds of the Odyssey
fully accessible and useable to any of today's computer-based musicians!Like it's precursor, it offers dual oscillators with mono or duophonic
modes. The Oddity features two syncable oscillators - fully tunable
across a six octave range, with sawtooth, sine, square and variable pulse
width waveforms. White and pink noise, a built-in A440 tone generator for tuning the oscillators,
host syncable LFO, ring modulator, resonant lowpass filter, highpass
filter, sample & hold, portamento, two envelope generators and a wealth
of modulation routing options are all plainly laid out just as on the original.Further enhancements include velocity sensitivity, the ability to
'Morph' between Presets and a unique flying slider feature which allows
you to throw sliders around at different speeds, recording these changes
within your host application. The GUI also features a glissando keyboard
and all on-screen parameters can easily be mapped to external MIDI
controllers. There are also user definable VCA and VCF velocity
parameters. The original had no patch memory, but the Oddity ships with
5 banks of 64 presets and has virtually unlimited patch storage. They went for the look of the common black-face Odyssey which was produced
before Arp switched over to the orange/black color scheme of their later
Odyssey models. Could the model copied here be the one with the famous illegal
Moog filter design with the beefier sound than other Odyssey
models? Any way you cut it, the Oddity is the real thing! It is an excellent, affordable and sensible
way to get your hands on a maintenance-free Arp Odyssey of your own.

big brother, the K250, the Kurzweil
K1000 is a sample playback instrument as well as a synthesizer. Weighed
down by its 76-note keyboard, the K1000 boasts many of the same
award-winning samples found in the K250 in a 24-note polyphonic
multitimbral synth. The famous Kurzweil piano is here, as well as the
gorgeous strings and brass too. The K1000 has emulations of almost any
orchestral instrument you can think of. And they're great sounding. The
popular rumor is that the samples were recorded using members of the
Boston Symphony orchestra-and it shows.The K1000 also has a very sophisticated digital/wave synthesizer
engine. K1000 patches start life as a digitally coded waveform that
Kurzweil calls a Soundfile. A Soundfile can be a sampled
waveform (coming from Kurzweil's famous samples like piano, string,
wind, etc...) or a digitally produced waveform like sine, sawtooth, or
square. Then, you put Soundfiles together into the layers of a
program. Effects are part of each layer as well.Now, for the bad news. All of this power is extremely difficult to
harness through the diminutive LCD display on the front panel. To make
matters worse, the backlight on the LCD is prone to burning out, so most
K1000's you find on the used market won't have a working backlight.
This problem can be fixed by using one of the third party backlight
replacements available on the web, but it is a relatively delicate
procedure that requires some basic knowledge of electronics.The K1000 also came in a series
of rackmount synths. The so-called ""1000 Series"" consists of no less
than ten different models of the rackmount version of the synth. Each
module in the series has a different set of sounds. Complicating things
further, you could upgrade these modules, so that they may have one name
on the front panel, but have the features and sounds of a different
model from the series. Some of the upgrades include:
• 1000 AX Plus Acoustic Expander (185 presets - all SX and HX plus more)
• 1000 GX Guitar Expander (100 presets)
• 1000 HX Horn Expander (75 presets)
• 1000 HXA Expansion ROM: Soprano sax, Alto sax, Baritone Sax, Brass stabs
• 1000 SX String Expander (99 presets)
• 1000 SXA Expansion ROM: Clarinet, Flute, Oboe , Bassoon, Fr. Horn, Timpani
• 1000 PX Professional Expander (120 presets)
• 1000 PXA Expansion ROM: Flute, Rhodes, E. bass, Drums, more waveforms
• 1000 PXB Expansion ROM: Steel guitar, Harp, Marimba, Tenor Sax, PercussionKurzweil later added aftertouch to the K1000 (an upgrade not
available to owners of the original K1000), known as the K1000SE
(Special Edition).The K1000 sells for peanuts on the used market today. It has some
fantastic sounds and the 76 key semi-weighted keyboard is reasonably fun
to play. If you couple it with third party computer software, it is
capable of making some really great sounds, even if its front panel is
minimalist and hides the monstrous capabilities of this synth. Kurzweil
always seemed to go overboard and this synth was no exception. At the
time of its introduction in 1988, 24-note polyphony was enormous (and
still not too bad today) and being multitimbral was a relatively new
feature as well. Kurzweil didn't disappoint. And that means these
instruments can still be valid and useful tools in your studio
today.",

synthesizer rack-module. It is big, not just in size but power and
creative potential. It features real time additive synthesis with 240

extensive programmability. The K150 implements a unique editing method
in which you mix, combine and alter the 150's 22 resident voices and 69
preset programs. You basically manipulate sounds on a harmonic level for
creating various new timbres. The keyboard is can be split into 3
regions and capable of up to 7 layers. With extensive layering effects
and abilities you can get some thick and unique sounds. There's 186
patches for memory storage and you can get up to 255 when you remove the
installed sound blocks or overwrite presets.The Fourier Synthesis (FS) is an upgrade to the standard K150 which
allows you to define new instrument models by editing their velocities
and envelopes, tuning intervals and more further expanding creative and
unique sound synthesis potential. The FS model needs to interface with
an Apple IIe to use Kurzweil's Sound Laboratory software for editing and
management in order to unlock the true power and potential of the
K150-FS. The oldest versions of this software is called SOUNDLAB, while
the newer ones are called .S.M.P. (Sound Modeling Program). The results
of this program are stored in the K150 as voices, which can be utilized
in up to seven layers of any of the three regions in any given program.Everything is modifiable and controllable about this synth. Pitch
bending, vibrato, EQ, chorusing, polyphonic after-pressure and full 16
channel MIDI implementation with almost everything being MIDI
controllable. However, for as big and powerful as the 150 is, its sound
generally seems to be a little thin, due to its digital nature. There is
no user-controllable filter. Merely a low-pass anti-aliasing filter,
which cuts off at around 9 to 10KHz, with the slope becoming noticeable
at about 7-8 KHz. Overall it's a wonderful synth but requires
considerable knowledge to operate well compared to most synthesizers.",

Laboratories. It's a very simple and cheap, 8-voice digital-analog
hybrid preset synthesizer, circa 1990. The sounds are generated by
digital oscillators, but the rest of the instrument is analog –
there are eight CEM3389 chips inside.The instrument is built in a cheap plastic body with a metal strip
around the tiny LCD display and some buttons on the top. The keyboard
has 61 velocity sensitive keys, there are Pitch Bend and Modulation
wheels (awkwardly located at the very top), and separate Volume and MIDI
Volume sliders (the K160 can control the volume of a MIDI slave
instrument in realtime). On the rear side, there is MIDI, Left &
Right outputs, Phones output, Pedal input (called ""Release Pedal"" here)
and two knobs for tuning and LCD brightness adjustment.In the K160's ROM, there are 4 banks with total of 128 sounds called
Presets, including various kinds of sounds like pianos, e-pianos,
strings, brasses, organs, guitars, basses, etc. Of course, the acoustic
sounds are obsolete by today's standards, but some Preset sounds are
still good: the pipe organ emulation is impressive and better than on
many of today's keyboards. However, the Presets can not be
modified.In the RAM, there are 32 performances, called Programs, which can be
modified or completely created by the user. Each Program can include up
to 8 Presets freely layered or split across the keyboard. The following
parameters can be set for each Preset in a Program: Dynamic allocation
(the number of oscillators per Preset), Bank and Preset number (you can
use Presets from only one Bank), Lower and Upper limit, Note shift (by
semitones), Volume, Portamento speed, Velocity to VCA (touch response,
only On/Off), Filter Cut-Off, Resonance amount and output assignment.
You can also assign the MIDI channel for each Preset in the Program. The
K160 came from the factory with 32 Programs which can be restored using
the Factory Setup. The user's Programs can be saved by memory dump to
an external storage device like a sequencer. There are no internal
effects.A rack-mount version, the M160, was also made. Solton also offered a
cheaper version, the K80 with 64 Presets, 16 Programs, and monophonic
output, but it did not allow for filter modification. Its rack-mount
version was called the M80. On the surface, the Solton K160 is nothing
to rave about, but it is a rare, unique, and cheap find.",

it is surpassed by the K1 and K5. The K3 is a wavetable synthesizer. It has
32 waveforms, some of which are samples of acoustic instruments like
piano and percussion as well as some unique waveforms. By combining two
of these waveforms you can create unique new sounds or add a twist to a
traditional sound. Since there are only 32 of these waveforms, the K3
also features a programmable digital waveform where you can tweak the
harmonic content of a waveform allowing for added flexibility and range
of sounds.What's really neat about the K3 is that (unlike the K1) it has analog filters and envelopes! So
although the sound may be digital at first, it sure does get warmed
going through the filter. The low pass resonant filter even has its own
envelope generator. There's also a high pass filter and a highly flexible
LFO. The K3 is an interesting synth, nicely bridging the gap between the

harmonic-building as its method of sound creation. Basically, you can
vary up to 126 harmonic levels generated by a sine wave via a bar-graph
type graphic display to create, shape and change your sound. De-tuning
can also be used to thicken or augment sounds too. In addition, each
harmonic has an independent choice of four 6-stage envelopes for further
tweaking and shaping. The K5 is also 15-part multi-timbral. Sounds can
be split, layered, overlapped and de-tuned for creating thicker sounds
or ensembles of instruments and sounds. It has 48 internal patches for
memory storage as well as a 48 patch external memory card. There are
also 48 patches for the multi-mode settings as well.The K5 is very digital in its synthesis approach and its overall sound
quality. However it has some surprisingly analog-like parameters. Its
filter is a Dynamic Digital Filter that has familiar slope, cutoff,
envelope amount, keyboard tracking and independent 6-stage envelope
controls. The Digital Dynamic Amplifier is set up like a 6-stage
envelope for overall sound shaping. The LFO has about six waveform
shapes, speed, delay and a new Trend setting which is related to the
delay parameter of the LFO. But programming Multi-Mode sounds is a bit
more modern in its approach to synthesis than analogs and requires a bit
of planning and experimenting.It should be noted that the user interface makes it particularly
difficult to program the K5 well. It's especially hard to tell the
envelope-to-harmonic routings, and the various bits of nomenclature used
by Kawai to indicate what does what can be a bit misleading.
Nonetheless, the K5 is a very powerful instrument for creating digital
sounds unlike any other. It works great in any MIDI studio or live
situation due mostly in part to its multitimbral abilities, unique
sounds and its approach to synthesis. It has been used by Jean Michel
Jarre.The K5m rack-module version is basically the same as the K5 except that
it has 126 adjustable harmonics and 4 assignable audio outputs and a
stereo mix output. If you plan to use the K5 strictly as a sound source
in an established MIDI studio, the K5M desktop module version is more
compact and practical than the keyboard version. The K5m has been used
by Jan Hammer.",

VCF (filter) and VCA envelope generators. It features 8-voice polyphony, a
4-voice mode using 2 DCO per voice, and a monophonic unison lead mode (8
stacked oscillators!!). The SX-210 certainly stacks up well against the
more popular Roland Juno-60 and
Korg Polysix synths.Program changes are entered using a global ""Increment"" wheel sort of
like those used on the Roland Alpha Juno series. Fortunately its
implementation is much better on the SX-210 - just hit a parameter
switch and adjust the dial to the desired value or effect. The downside
is there are only 32 memory patches. The oscillator section offers 3
waveforms, a sub-osc and PWM control plus a noise generator. The low
pass VCF (filter) has its own  ADSR envelope generator. There's also a
high pass filter. The LFO can modulate both DCO, VCF and VCA, all at the
same time! It is also one of the only synths to feature both glissando
and portamento. The SX-210 is pretty rare, only a few thousand may have
been made. This rarity and its capable sound quality make it a great

It was manufactured by Kawai but originally released under the Teisco brand-name in Japan when Kawai bought out Teisco. The Kawai SX-240 and the Kawai SX-210 never got much attention due to entering the market during the time of the digital revolution and poor marketing. Its main analog competitors of the time were the Korg Polysix and the Roland Juno 6/60. Being among the first in the era of MIDI, its MIDI implementation is very basic and it receives on all channels. In terms of patch editing, the SX-240 is very much like a Roland Alpha Juno or Moog Source which resort to using a dedicated data-wheel to edit the values of selected parameters. Four scroll buttons allow you to select the parameter you wish to edit. All the parameters have an LED light on the right hand side of the face of the SX-240 to make it very easy to see what you're editing, though only one parameter can be edited at a time. Saving your edited sounds is very easy thanks to a huge electroluminescent display and using the keys of the keyboard to type the name of your edited sound alphanumerically. The SX-240 has a big, wide and full analog sound, courtesy of its two analog DCOs and one sub-osc per voice. You have the options of poly-8, poly-4 and mono modes. In mono mode it is possible to have all 24 oscillators stacked into one for an extremely powerful sound. Leads, basses, brass, drones, pads and strings all have a unique analog sound on the SX-240. Strings and pads get especially warm and fluid when switching on the Ensemble effect, which is just a chorus. The SX-240 also has a function called Brass, which is actually a ring-mod effect. Modulation possibilities are somewhat limited due to having just one saw wave on DCO1, but with adjustable PW and PWM plus a noise generator, you can find some great sound possibilities. The LFO can be routed everywhere in the DCO, VCF and the VCA. It also has an LFO trigger button to start or stop the LFO on command. The SX-240 uses eight SSM 2044 filter chips which help make up its powerful filter sound. The filter also strangely jumps into self oscillation around the value point of 98 to 99. There are also both portamento and glissando, though it was uncommon to find both of these effects on synths of the time. The SX-240 also has the option of being placed in Split or Dual modes. In Split mode you can assign two patches to be played in a split on the keyboard. In Dual mode two patches can be played at the same time for a rich, warm, and layered sound. It also has a built-in, real time 1,500 note sequencer and chord memory. The SX-240 is often said to sit somewhere in between the Polysix and the Juno 6/60 in terms of sound. While that could be a generally true statement, the fact is the SX-240 does not sound like either of them, but rather has its own unique analog sound. It's also pretty rare today. Most found second hand have NI-Cad battery issues causing a common symptom of not being able to retain saved patches to memory. This battery must be replaced or modified to a Li-Ion battery to ensure a long life for the SX-240. Even without showing any symptoms, it's best to have the Ni-Cad looked at for possible leakage.",

it. Encore Electronics has come through with Knobby, a Midi Controller designed 
to give you control over a wide variety of current, obsolete, and future MIDI equipment.
The Knobby  is a hardware controller (pictured above) that is programmed using its software for your personal computer.
You basically assign which knobs will transfer what type of Midi-data and up to 120
functions can be assigned to the knobs via 15 various banks or groups.
Once programmed you can use it as an external controller for just about any synth
or Midi device and the Midi data it transmits can also be recorded into a sequencer for real-time capture and playback
of all your tweaking and editing. Pictured below is a screenshot of the software
configuring the Knobby for the BitHeadz Retro-AS1! The Knobby opens up the parameters of all your MIDI equipment with the ability to
send any MIDI controller, including Non Registered and Registered Parameters (NRPNs), and
up to 55 byte System Exclusive (Sysex) messages. This allows it to control most
synths from the Roland Juno-106 to the 
JP-8000 for example! Whatever parameters your
synths allow to be Midi controlled can be assigned to a knob on the Knobby for real-time control.Some synths such as Roland's Alpha Junos, MKS-series, JX-series and D-series are difficult or tedious
to program since they have done away with knobs and sliders, requiring specific
controllers (PG-300, PG-200, PG-800 and PG-1000 respectively). But with the Knobby
you can finally edit those synths with several hands-on knobs and in real-time and 
those tweaks can easily be transmitted into your sequencer while recording. The Knobby 
is a wonderful tool for anyone with any number knobless-midi synths. 
Pictured below is another software screenshot assigning a Sysex Message to a Knob for 
the Roland MKS-80.The Knobby also works great with modern knobless synths such as Virtual Synths. 
ReBirth, Reaktor, Reason 
and Creamware Pulsar all require use of the mouse
for tweaking which means only one knob or slider can be changed at a time. With
Knobby properly configured you can use its knobs to control several parameters
on the fly and they will be recorded too. From Midi programming to Midi mixing,
the Knobby can be a very useful tool for any Midi studio. It ships with pre-configured
set-ups for many synths that you may already have. 
Click here 
for a listing of these. Even if your synth is not on their list,  
since the Knobby supports any instrument that responds to MIDI controllers, NRPNs, and most 
sysex messages you should have no trouble getting it to work with your Midi gear.
You can even share your own custom-made libraries with others!",

means you can program it to control almost every MIDI parameter on any
MIDI synthesizer! It's perfect for those of you with classic MIDI Roland
gear like a Juno-106, Alpha Juno, JX-8p, etc. You can stop searching for
lost Roland PG-series programmers to get easy, hands-on control of these
synths and more! It can also be used to control rack effect units,
software synths, sound modules, DAWs, and other MIDI gear! Tired of
using a mouse to tweak your ReBirth, Reason, or Retro
AS-1 parameters? Need a MIDI mixer? The SlideMate is the answer!The SlideMate's faders are assigned their MIDI functions and channels
using the included computer software for Mac and PC only. You can create
custom definitions or use pre-made definitions for tons of popular
synths, and more are downloadable from Encore. Drag and drop the
preset definitions or your own custom ones onto an image of the
SlideMate to automatically program all its faders! Once you've loaded
definitions into the SlideMate, it can be used independent of the
computer/software and will retain its settings in memory, even when
turned off.The SlideMate is a tough, robust and well built little machine with
all the programmability you'd ever want for a UNIVERSAL MIDI controller.
The support for SysEx makes this a must have for owners of old MIDI
gear. Your Fader moves can be recorded into sequences to enable true
hands-on MIDI automation of all your MIDI gear! And unlike other MIDI
controllers, the SlideMate has twice the resolution for smoother
tweaking as well as a MIDI merger built in, scene/panic button,
programmable MIDI delay, non-volatile memory, and rugged steel 60mm
faders. If you prefer rotary knobs to 60mm faders, you can check out the
Encore Knobby...equally as programmable and
well built, but with knobs. (The knobby is a bit cheaper because faders
are more expensive.)",

It is a much more compact instrument than the Modular Model 11 series of synthesizers they had been making thus far. It is a monophonic analog synthesizer with traditional controls, knobs, switches and two oscillators for a good solid analog synth sound. Initally released as a keyboard in 1978, a 3-unit rack-mount system was later released in 1979. Although it is mostly a traditional analog synth with stable oscillators and lots of knobs that allow you to control the ADS envelope, the filter section and the nice LFO, it did offer some unique features for its time. Most notably, the oscillator waveforms can be continuously swept across for a very cool morph from square to saw to pulse, etc. This, as well as note on/off and other parameters can be controlled via CV/gate. External sounds can be processed through the Kobol filter and envelope sections too. The rack version came in four different components. The Kobol Rack (Expander I) was essentially only the VCO/VCF/VCA/LFO sections of the Kobol in a rack module. The Expander 2 was an add-on to the Kobol that added some new processing modules such as ring modulation, sample-hold, and envelope followers as well as extra VCA and LFO modules. The Programmer rack module contained the memory circuits for storing patches and sequencing. And the KM8 was an 8-channel rack-mount mixer. The connections between modules were normalized but could be bypassed by external patches, similar to other semi-modulars like the ARP 2600 and Korg MS-20. The Kobol looked and sounded great, and was quickly snapped up by the big names in synthesizers of the time. But being a small French company, RSF were never able to truly mass produce these on the same sort of scale that Moog, Arp, Roland or Korg could. Less than 200 Kobol keyboards were made, around 800 Kobol Racks, 200 Expander 2's, 200 Programmer's and only a handful of the KM8's. This makes them quite rare and quite pricey too! They have been used by Vince Clarke, Vangelis, Jean-Michel Jarre, Depeche Mode, Peter Gabriel, and Hans Zimmer.",

oscillators that can generate over 2,000 different single-cycle 8-bit
digital waveforms! Covered by knobs, the Wave still looks analog and
this comprises the ""Analog Control Panel"". More complex and new-wave
editing of the wavetables and samples is covered by the ""Digital Control

record any filtering and wave changes, in real-time!!The more commonly encountered Wave 2.3 (pictured) followed the 2.2 and had enhanced
sample-playback capabilities. The sampler was pretty full-featured for
its time and included upgraded 12-bit digital waveforms, Fourier

the Wave Computer sounded harsh and tinny. In 1981, the PPG Wave 2 was
released which added analog VCF and VCA filter and envelopes to warm the
digital sound. The original Wave 2 had 8-voice polyphony, like the 2.2
and 2.3, but it had only one oscillator per voice. The 2.2 offered two
oscillators per voice which opened up a whole new realm of sonic
possibilities because two separate wavetable sounds could now be
combined.Although PPG fell apart in the mid-late 1980's, their technology found
its way into fellow German music company, Waldorf. The Microwave series
represents modern day PPG technology, continuing the wavetable synthesis
method with modern filters, envelopes, MIDI, and more.

magnetic ""pick-ups"". Lounge Lizard's interface gives you superb control and
flexibility of how each of these parameters function in shaping your
sounds. Easy to use controls for a Wah-Wah effect, Phaser, Tremolo, and
Delay are there as well. MIDI/Tempo sync is available for the effects
and every control can be assigned to a MIDI continuous controller (via
MIDI learn) for real-time control! A big fat ""old school"" analog VU
meter and volume knob are there too for managing your levels.
Unfortunately there is no on-screen keyboard for triggering notes
without external MIDI controllers.It ships with a boat-load of preset sounds to get you going. All patches
are selected from the Browser column at the left of the screen, allowing you 
to organize and categorize your sounds in meaningful ways. Lounge Lizard's
biggest competition may be Native Instruments' Elektrik Piano, which offers significantly less
editability of it's sounds but uses sampled sounds instead of modeling
(which may make it sound truer than Lounge Lizard). ",

unique new software-based modular synthesizer. Unlike most other modular
software synths on the market which attempt to either recreate vintage
gear or out-do themselves trying to become the ultimate synth, the new
Tassman takes a unique approach using physical modeling to recreate
natural acoustic sounds. But these can be manipulated in very flexible
synth-like ways thus allowing you to play a piano sound with a violin
bow, for example, or strike a flute with a mallet. Sound intriguing?Not just a modular system, the Tassman is really a sound design
system. It is the first modular software to incorporate physical modeling of
analog hardware, acoustic objects and instruments with real-time parameter
control, designed with both the diversified needs of the studio professional and
the desktop musician in mind.In the Builder mode you create your sound by selecting the modules
you want and routing your signal between them. The library of modules contains all of the building blocks
found in traditional analog synthesizers including VCOs, filters,
envelopes, and effects, as well as the acoustic models of strings,
mallets, drum membranes, and more.Then you have to switch
to the Player mode to play your sounds polyphonically or for use in sequences.
Some features include 44.1kHz audio file output, stereo output, 
real-time MIDI support, multi-timbral and more.Some of the Modules include:

acoustic instruments, analog and FM synthesizers, loop processors to
entirely unique hybrid creations simply not possible by any other means.The Tassman is a tightly integrated environment comprising of three
main interfaces: the Player, the Builder and the Browser. With the
Tassman Player (pictured above) you are ready to play any of the synths included in the
library. The automatically generated Player interface is inspired by
classic analog hardware making it easy to tweak any of the existing
factory presets to create and save your own custom sounds. And every parameter can be controlled via MIDI!The Builder (below) allows you to customize the way individual modules are
connected within a synth, or even create your own instruments from the
ground up, using an intuitive 'building block' approach. The Builder
interface presents the patch associated with each synth in a way that is
easy to understand and logical. A patch can easily be modified or
created by dragging the color-coded building blocks from the bank of
modules. You get unlimited modules per patch. Finally, the Browser is where you find and organize all the
Tassman elements used in the Player and Builder: performances, synths,
presets, modules, MIDI Links, imported patches and sub patches. The
Browser's Filters and Locate function make navigating and organizing
Tassman elements a breeze.From unrivaled recreations of analog and acoustic instruments, to wildly
adventurous cinematic textures, the Tassman puts the shape of sound
design in your hands. The Tassman also offers total integration with today's most powerful

analog synthesizer from Scottish synth designer Ken MacBeth. The M3X is
similar to the Minimoog in that it features
three oscillators and a transistor-ladder filter for warm analog sounds
in a simple, streamlined package, although the M3X goes beyond the
original Moog. The M3X has been designed to operate via MIDI or
traditional 1V/Octave control voltage input and output, as well as the
standard S Trig interface as used by many analog systems.The M3X has three dedicated oscillators, each with five waveform
types and user selectable destinations including cross-modulation
capabilities. In addition to the oscillators, there is a noise generator
and an external audio input amp for processing other synths or sound
sources. The filter section is a transistor-ladder type similar to that
used in the Moog synthesizers and sounds totally warm and at times harsh
(a good harsh). It offers 24dB/oct low-pass filtering with controls for
frequency cutoff, resonance, envelope amount, attack, decay/release and
sustain. The voltage-controlled amplifier also features attack, decay/release and
sustain controls. The Mixer section offers volume controls for each of
the oscillators, noise generator and external audio input plus a master
volume. The digital menu system provides access to the MIDI, LFO,
Portamento, and various tuning and scaling parameters. Absolutely
simple, hands-on and easy to understand but full of big beefy analog
sounds.The M3X2 is an
updated version of the Scottish analog synth. According to MacBeth: ""We
have taken a good look at the original design and improved upon it from
a user interface point of view, and the M3X2 sports some new
features...the interface jacks are now on the front of the unit as
opposed to rear which takes into account those users who want to
integrate the M3X2 into the up and coming M5
as well as any other modular systems...many have commented on the
excellent sound quality of the Filter as used in the M3X. Well, it is
the same Filter, but now the self-oscillating super-matched transistor
ladder Filter features temperature compensation allowing keyboard
tracking to be accurate over a full 10 octave range during
oscillation!""The Oscillators have featured one or two improvements too! Some of
the IC 'Op-Amps' have been replaced with even more 'discrete'
transistor circuits and their outputs are now AC as opposed to DC,
providing easier control of Cross Modulation...and we are still using
the excellent 10 turn potentiometers on the Frequency controls. The VCA
has had a number of improvements too, with a higher and cleaner Signal
to Noise ratio! The M3X2 is built to the same standard as the previous
model, and is housed in a quality solid steel and aluminium rack-mount
casing built for the studio and the road. The M3X2 comes in a choice of
two colours: The Bluebay M3X2 is to sport a stylish dark, dark blue
finish and the Studio Systems model is to sport the jet black

A very big ARP 2600. But this is actually
a modern analog synthesizer; it is the MacBeth M5. While reminiscent of 
the 2600, this is not a clone. It's a semi-modular synthesizer that
features a significant array of real-time analog controls with
absolutely no digital circuitry at all. Totally faithful to the design
and concept of early analog synthesizers, all sounds must be created by
hand, tweaking knobs, patching cables and using a bit of creativity.
There is no patch memory, no MIDI and no USB. Just really great analog
sounds.Sound and construction quality are all top notch! The M5 is quite
big, the front panel measuring 30"" wide  by 26"" deep and positioned at
an 80 degree angle for maximum playability. There is a 3"" drop at the
front of the unit to allow for a keyboard to be positioned directly in
front of the M5 (use of a Kenton MIDI-CV converter may be needed to
control it from a standard MIDI keyboard controller). The controls and
sockets are generously spaced out in a logical fashion. The entire synth
is housed in a solid, rugged and durable steel casing although some
'custom' versions have been built into wooden enclosures. Likewise,
there are some 'custom' models that also have alternative paint-jobs
on the face plate, including Blue, Red and White models.Being semi-modular essentially means that this is a
modular synth, but all the modules have been pre-configured and somewhat
pre-connected already by the manufacturer. Some of the diagrams on the
face-plate illustrate the pre-wired (normailzed) connections for each of
the modules, although there are still plenty of patch points for making
your own connections. To start, there are three oscillators which offer
your basic sine, triangle, sawtooth and square (w/ PWM) waveforms, plus
a noise generator that can output white, pink or a unique Slow Random
noise modes. In addition to these sound generators, there is an external
audio input pre-amplifier for bringing in other sounds for processing
through the M5. The oscillators all offer a broad range of tuning, even
micro-tuning possibilities.There are two discrete filters on-board: a 24 dB/oct lowpass
transistor-ladder type filter and a 12 dB/oct with Low Pass, Band Pass,
High Pass and Notch filter types. Both filters can self oscillate and
feature ADSR envelope generators. There are two LFOs with four
waveforms: Rising Ramp, Falling Ramp, Triangular and Rectangular. Each
LFO features its own Rate control, output, and trigger outputs.
Sample-And-Hold is also possible with LFO 2 (and also from the Noise
Gen). There are four VCAs in the M5. One for each of the two voltage-controlled
filters, and the other two VCAs are incorporated into the Voltage
Controlled Panning circuit / stereo output.Additionally, there is a Ring Modulator, Spring Reverb, two Audio
Mixers, two Control Voltage Mixers and two Lag Processors. The Audio
Mixers allow you to control the level of the oscillators going into the
VCF (filters) (and they can be pushed into overdrive for some distortion)
and they can also be used to send the oscillator signals for processing
elsewhere in the synth (or outside the synth to an external processor).
The Control Voltage Mixers also work with the VCF (filters), allowing a
variety of sources to affect the timbre of the relevant filter: VCF 1
has inputs for Keyboard CV, LFO 1, LFO 2 and EG 2, and VCF 2 has inputs
for Keyboard CV, LFO 1, OSC 3 and the Noise Generator. The Sample &
Hold processors are fed into the Lag Processors, which provide a
'slewing' function very similar to the Analog Glide used in the
Keyboard CV part of the synth.The M5 is really a wonderful instrument. Many modern modular analog
systems continue the modular concept of providing users custom options
and possibilities in designing their own instrument. But that can be a
daunting and expensive task for most musicians. Much like the way ARP
redefined the modular synth by offering the semi-modular concept: a
pre-conceived modular system with much of the flexibility of traditional
modulars and fewer of the limitations of compact keyboard synths, the M5
brings the semi-modular concept to today's musician's. On top of that,
the M5 makes no attempt to abandon its analog heritage in favor of
digital components or modern functions - for better or worse. The M5 is
a true analog synthesizer reminiscent of the ARP 2600 but with expanded
features and possibilities and upgraded analog componentry. The M5 (and M5N) may seem capable of kicking the original ARP 2600s
to the back of the closet, but these synths are in fact more rare than
the 30 year old 2600! To date only about 90 M5s have been produced and
sold, as they are all hand built to order at MacBeth Studio Systems. But
unlike the 2600, these are still being assembled and are available for
purchase from MacBeth Studio Systems and their distributors.",

It succeeds at emulating
the sound and character of the 303 better than most. This may be because
it is analog and not virtual emulation technology. It is a half-rack
desktop or rack-mount module which houses a nice analog VCO synth engine
complete with 303-like controls and knobs.  Front panel knobs control
basic but familiar parameters: waveshape, VCF cutoff, resonance (Q),
EnvMod, Accent and volume.The MAB-303 brings the 303 into the '90's with a few added features.
First there is a new waveform to play with - pulse. The MAB-303 has MIDI
implementation which applies to some parameters. The knobby-controls are
not MIDI'd (argh!) however the following new features are MIDI
controllable: LFO, pitch mod, pitch bending, MIDI velocity and auto
glide.Sound wise, it makes a convincing 303. It isn't as squelchy in the
self-resonance area however its many new features should more than make
up for that. The MAB-303 works very well with a MIDI sequencer (there is
no built in sequencer unlike the original) and although the Env Mod,
CutOff and other front panel controls can't be controlled by MIDI the
MAB-303 makes it easier for new and experienced users to use a 303-type
synth in a modern studio environment. It has been used by ATB and 
Acid Junkies.",

from Roland, the SoundMaster Memory Rhythm SR-88 is a programmable drum
machine with four analog sounds. It has much in common not only with the
first Dr. Rhythm, but with a number of other simple drum machines that
proliferated around this time - models such as the Clef Master Rhythm,
Amdek Rhythm Machine, Movement Sequence Memory Rhythm and EDC SR-99.
Some were available in kit form and all were aimed at the musician who
wanted the flexibility of a programmable drum machine, but were unable
to afford the high price tag of something like a Roland
CR-78 or Linn
LM-1.As with the DR-55, the SR-88 has six patterns consisting of two 16-step
bars and two patterns consisting of two 12-step bars. Patterns may be
played as bar A only, bar B only, bar A and B consecutively, or in a
""fill in"" mode where bar B is played at the end of each four,
eight or sixteen bar cycle. Programming a pattern is performed in step
mode by selecting a sound and pressing the start button for a note or
the stop button for a rest. Each press of either button advances the
pattern one step, until it cycles around at the end. Once programmed,
patterns cannot be chained together to form songs, but may be selected
on the fly.The sounds themselves consist of a Kick, Snare, Closed Hi-Hat and
Cymbal. Unlike the DR-55, there is no Rim-shot, but the Hi-Hat is fully
programmable. There no is Accent facility, but the combination of Hi-Hat
and Cymbal on the same step provides some degree of dynamic variation.
The sounds themselves are a little less punchy those of the DR-55,
sounding more like those found in earlier drum machines from Roland and
Korg.Overall, the SR-88 proved very successful and went through a number of
iterations during the several years it was produced. Earlier models are
housed in a blue chassis, while later ones sport a more sober grey
chassis with the addition of clock and trigger out sockets. There is
also a straightforward modification that adds a clock in socket for
those wishing to slave the SR-88 to another device.Notable users include The Cocteau Twins.",

affordable drum machine featuring programmable patterns rather than
presets. It soon had a competitor in the form of the SoundMaster SR-88,
which was so similar in appearance and sound to the DR-55 that it might
make you wonder why Roland didn't sue SoundMaster out of existence.
Roland clearly didn't, as the SR-88 was followed by the ST-305 ""Stix"".
In terms of features and sophistication the Stix is somewhere between
the BOSS DR-55 and Roland TR-606, with
programming like the DR-55 and individual volume controls for each
instrument like the TR-606. While it was soon eclipsed by the TR-606,
which featured a higher number of patterns and the ability to chain them
together into songs, the Stix does offer individual audio outputs for
each sound. There is also a trigger input and two trigger outputs - one
a constant clock pulse and the other programmable via the accent.The sounds on the Stix are limited to kick, snare, high tom, low tom,
closed high hat, open high hat and cymbal. There is also the accent,
which has its own level control and affects all instruments on each beat
it is applied to. Patterns are limited to six with sixteen steps per
bar, and two with twelve steps per bar. Each pattern can be programmed
as a single two bar pattern (A and B) or as two one bar patterns (A or
B). In addition to playing one bar repeatedly or both in succession,
there's also a ""fill in"" mode, where bar A plays repeatedly until bar B
plays once at the end of every four, eight or sixteen bars.Overall the Stix is a fun machine despite its limitations. It has a
subtly different character to the contemporary Roland TR-606 and Korg KPR-77, while also benefiting from
separate audio outputs as standard. It's unlikely that anyone has used
the Stix on a really famous recording, but the cheap price of the
SoundMaster drum machines probably means that many electronic musicians
learnt their craft on one!",

for Mac and PC based VST-compatible audio programs. It has a basic and simple
design and architecture just like the classic Moog and Roland synths it is modeled after.
It also packs quite a punch with its monophonic analog sound and quality
Moog-like filter. It sounds great when generating basses, leads, growls,
303 sounds, synth percussion and effects.So what's the Mercury-1 got to offer you? It is a two oscillator monosynth with pulse-width modulation,
a sub-osc, a warmly overdriven TCF 24dB/oct lowpass filter modeled after classic analog
Moog-type filters. It's a lot like the Model-E, but falls short with only two
oscillators as opposed to the Model-E's three. But Mercury-1 does have more extensive
envelope and modulation features. It also has 4-part multitimbrality so each time you 
open a Mercury-1 you actually load 4 mono synths! This allows you
to have 4 patches layered up on top of each other. You can add more since
the number of Mercury VST-Instruments you can have is dependent on your computer's RAM.Modulation comes in many forms on the Mercury-1. A classic LFO offers some
basic waveforms, sample-and-hold features and MID sync.
Oscillator Sync can also be modulated by the LFO and the Envelope
Generator. The TCA section is a basic amp with Volume and Drive
via TC ""SoftSat"" algorithm for analog sounding distortion. It is switchable
between ENV 2 or Gate modes. There are two ADSR envelope generators assignable
to various sections including the TCF filter, Pitch Mod, PWM, and TCA.
Additionally there are pitch and mod wheels, glide, ring modulation,
white noise generators and more. MIDI controller data can be recorded and sent to all
of the controls of Mercury-1 for real-time programming.Mercury-1 provides an excellent all-purpose analog mono-synth
full of classic sounds...without all the hassles of a real classic synth.
Although it costs as much as some better featured competing softsynths, musicians using 
VST-compatible sequencers would benefit from adding this plug-in to their arsenal. 
It offers clean sounds and works
seamlessly with VST sequencers in realtime. It does have a few limitations 
to be aware of. It uses high-note priority instead of the more common last-note
priority method. And its single-trigger envelopes mean that you have to actually leave a brief gap
between notes to re-trigger the envelope. Otherwise you may hear your notes decay away
under the envelope of your first note if you play too fast. Careful sequencing 
can easily overcome this sometimes annoying performance feature. But it's easy
to use and will be both familiar to seasoned programmers, and an easy learn
for those new to classic analog mono-synths.",

machine. Run loops, synths, voice or entire mixes through this and
filter them in stereo or dual mono. It sounds great!The two filters are identical and totally independent of each other. The
circuitry is analog too. The VCF (filters) have their own envelopes and
there is a useful LFO for nice sweeping or pulsing effects. The LFO can
also be MIDI synced to your music (it's a little tricky though).There is a great implementation of MIDI control on the Mutator. Control
the filter cutoff from your sequencer by hitting notes on the keyboard.
That's it, the notes on your keyboard and the pitch-bend correspond to
the different degrees of cutoff. There is no patch memory, but that's
ok. The Mutator is a machine that's meant to be grabbed and played with
live while either going to tape or live on stage. Filtering music for an
effect has become very common these days and the Mutator is among the

It's basically
a plastic & metal box with a couple colorful sliders  and a few buttons. Its
25-note keyboard uses membrane buttons rather than real keys. This can
be uncomfortable and unreliable to play. Other synths that tried this approach to 
touch-keyboards include the much better sounding EDP Wasp and the more
advanced touch sensitive Buchla and Serge machines. The inclusion of 
a built-in speaker indicates that the Mini-Synthesizer was, and always will
be an entry-level, ultra-compact, portable synth.As for the sounds, well there isn't much here. The Mini-Synthesizer features
just one analog VCO with just a Pulse waveform. Although there is an octave
divider and dedicated LFO for a Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) effect, this single
VCO does not stack up against other synths if you're looking for thick or punchy
analog bass, organ and synth sounds. There's a rather quirky analog filter onboard
too. Two sliders control the cutoff-point at the start and end of a note, 
another slider controls the sweep rate between them and the fourth slider
adjusts phase-shifting of the filter. Resonance, phase in/out and sensitivity
are handled by on/off switches. Finally it also has a 2x switch which also creates a phase-shifty
effect.Some models (unlike the one pictured above) feature an analog delay effect for some nice echo. 
They also feature a Ribbon-Controller above the keyboard for a glide effect.
Although these may be nice, the Mini-Synth still lacks memory, ADSR envelope
controls, CV/Gate and actual keys. It may be capable of a low bass sound that could be 
worth sampling but the lack of controllability and playability leave much to be desired.
And unless you're into esoteric gear, the Mini-Synthesizer is at best, a collectible.
It has been used by Van Halen, Jean-Michel Jarre, Jimmy Edgar, and the Moog Cookbook.",

Instead of three VCOs, the Minicon has just a single analog oscillator,
but thanks to Steiner-Parker's engineering they claimed it actually
sounded more like two oscillators, and was incredibly stable too, which
was a very important feature at the time compared with some of its more
popular competition.Flanked by classic solid wood end-panels, the four-octave keyboard is
graced by a clean, simple and logically laid out control panel with 17
knobs (and 19 switches) for total hands-on control. The keyboard itself
could be switched between three different octave ranges (low, middle and
high) and had portamento and a pitch bend knob.The oscillator offered two waveforms (saw or square) plus a pulse-width
mode as well as an independent noise source, continuously variable from
white to pink noise. The resonant filter section offered three modes:
low pass, band pass or high pass. A unique envelope section had Attack
and Decay controls, plus ACD (attack converted to delay), which allows
delayed envelopes for double attack effects. The VCA can be triggered or
enveloped. A simple LFO offers square or triangle waveforms with
adjustable speed and depth and is assignable to the filter and the
oscillator. Additional features include Sample & Hold, Legato
triggers, a CV/Gate interface for use with other gear and an internal
headphone driver.Steiner-Parker was a Salt Lake City, Utah based company formed primarily
by Nyle Steiner and Dick Parker. As something of a boutique
manufacturer, never achieving the mass-market production scale of Moog,
Arp or Sequential Circuits, the synths made by Steiner-Parker between
1975 to 1979 (when the company dissolved) are exceptionally rare and
very high in quality.",

synthesizer that rivals the popular Minimoog with its fat tone, durable

circuitry as the modular SynthaSystem.
Interestingly, the Synthacon's filter can self-oscillate like the
Minimoog, but has an opposite polarity so it doesn't lose any volume
when resonance is increased as do the Minimoog and Odyssey's filters.Each of the Synthacon's 3 oscillators can be modulated by a variety of
sources: LFO, EG1, EG2, VCF, sample-and-hold, and other oscillators.
White and Pink noise make for brilliant ocean/wind sounds. The
filter is a multimode resonant beast switchable between high, band and
lowpass filtering. It can be used to filter each of the oscillators and
the noise gens. The shape of the filtering can be controlled by EG2,
sample-and-hold, VCO3 or the keyboard. The voltage-controlled amp can control the
oscillators, noise and filter. And there are (2) envelope generators
which can control the VCA, oscillators, noise and filter.Earlier models of the Synthacon had silver-faced front panels. Later a
duophonic upgrade, the ""Two Voice Synthacon"" was released. The Synthacon
has been used by Earth Wind and Fire, Joe Walsh, the Doors,
Frank Zappa and John Paul Jones.",

it deserves some attention. It's great for creating sound effects
including thunder, wind, surf, race cars, sirens, horns, explosions, jet
airplanes, ""tunnel"" sound processing, and many, many more. But when it
comes to reproducing natural acoustic sounds...well, good luck. It
claims to simulate piano, organ, trumpet, accordion, violin, oboe,
drums, guitar and many more but most are pretty questionable.But as an analog processor and sound design machine, the SynthaSystem
shines. With up to 74 knobs and switches (or more) and its expandable
modular design you can create some wacky noises! It can also be used to
process existing sounds via an external audio input! Very cool for
filtering stuff! The SynthaSystem may be uncommon but it can be an
affordable alternative to similar synths.",

They are analog modular systems that began production in 1974, and continue to be produced to this day. The Serge concept was that a powerful, musical and great sounding analog modular system could, unlike the Buchlas, Moogs and ARPs of the time, be smaller, more compact and most importantly: cost less, making them far more accessible to musicians looking to jump into the bold new world of electronic music and sound design.Although Serge was French, the modular systems that bore his name were orignally designed and produced in Los Angeles, CA. Initially designed in 1974 (in Serge's home), mass production of the systems began in 1975 and continued until 1986. There was a rough period between 1986 to 1993 where modules were still produced to special order (slowly), but full production resumed again in 1993 after Serge's circuit designs were sold to Rex Probe (an early collaborator) who went on to found Sound Transform Systems, who continue to produce many of the original Serge modules, plus a few new one's of their own design.Influences of the Buchla can be seen in Serge systems, such as touch sensitive keyboards & sequencers, random voltage generators, function generators, and matrix mixers. Yet the Serge has many unique designs of its own such as the Wave Multiplier module and the use of banana plugs in lieu of traditional patch cords. Its filters are unqiue sounding but it may be the Wave Multiplier module that truly sets a Serge apart as it is a totally unique synthesizer section that sits between the Oscillator and Filter sections and allowed for external audio or control voltage signals to be used to modulate the timbre of the oscillator's tones.Originally, Serge systems were custom built to order. Like any modular system a buyer would pick and choose individual modules they want and assemble them into a cabinet. However, to reduce the price tag and make them more accessible to musicians not interested in building a modular synth from scratch, Sound Transform Systems sells Serge systems in pre-configured systems: Shop Panels and the M-Class.Shop PanelsShop Panels are complete systems that take up just 2 or 3 panel-spaces in a modular cabinet or rack-mount. There are essentially four model types: The Animal - a traditional dual oscillator design, the Blue Voice (and Blue Control) - a traditional three oscillator design, the Red Voice (and Red Control) - a more unique dual oscillator system, and the Soup Kitchen models which offer some of Serge's more ecclectic modules for sound manipulation and creation using external audio signals.The Shop Panel (Animal on top, unknown config below)M-ClassThe M-Class panels are more compact ""half-width"" panels that fit two to a panel or ""M-Boat"". Two M-Class panels joined by an M-Boat can be rack mounted or installed in a larger modular cabinet/system. Compact as they are, they are still considered complete systems, pairing anywhere from 4 to 5 modules into effective packages like the Creature - the smallest self contained Serge, to the Gator - a rhythmic pulse generator for bringing the sounds of another model (like the Creature) to life. The M-Class systems are intended to be mixed and matched and combined to create your own mini system without having to build a system from scratch, one module at a time. These smaller pre-configured systems can get you up and running and are a more affordable and intuitive way to build your own Serge, whether you choose just one M-Class model or a dozen!M-Class: Gator + CreatureIndividual Modules:Serge Systems have been used by Stereolab, John Adams, Vince Clarke, RadioHead, Jon Hassell, Richie Hawtin, Ingram Marshall, Moby, Stevie Wonder, Skinny Puppy, Sonic Boom, Frank Zappa, and many others.",

It was designed by Marvin Minsky and Edward Fredkin, both MIT professors
with an interest in artificial intelligence. Intended as a compositional
aid, the Muse is unlike most synthesizers out there, which may have
contributed to its poor sales. Even so, it managed to make its mark upon
the world of music, especially among the avant garde.In lieu of a keyboard, the Muse uses eight 40-position slider switches
which control a series of digital logic circuits using complicated
algorithms (the Muse is considered one of the first digital sequencers).
The binary output from the logic circuits is fed into a
digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and the output from the DAC is fed
into a simple VCO. The result is a sequence of notes which, depending on
the slider settings, can take years to loop back around to the
beginning!Operation of the Muse is not particularly intuitive, yet it is not too
difficult to get started. Four of the sliders control the interval of
notes, and the other four control the overall theme. A bar-graph lamp
display near the sliders shows the status of the logic gates. Another
set of sliders control the volume from the internal speaker, the tempo
of the sequence, and the pitch. Additional switches allow you to start
the sequence from the beginning, step through it note-by-note, or
substitute a rest point in place of the lowest note. The owner's manual
provided slider settings for example tunes, as well as templates where
the user could log settings which had resulted in interesting sequences.The Muse retailed for only a brief period of time in the early 1970's,
and is considered extremely rare. The exact number of units sold is
unknown, but is thought to be under 300. Even more rare are the
accessories Triadex produced to go along with the Muse, including an
Amplifier module (with an external speaker), a Multi-Muse Cable (used to
daisy-chain multiple Muses together), and a Light Show module, a color
organ whose 4 colored lamps blink in time to the signals coming from the
Muse. All these accessories shared the Muse's unique design styling,
too.While it's very difficult to master, and nearly impossible to get it to
play a specific song, the Muse offers nearly endless potential for
random music generation. Set the sliders, switch it to automatic mode,
and it will produce all sorts of bleeps and bloops. Add the Light Show
module to the mix, and it becomes a visual spectacle as well. It's too
bad the Muse used a proprietary I/O for communicating with other Triadex
products, as it means the Muse can not be used to control any other
synthesizers.",

Mini Synth. The original MWT-01 Midi Wave theremin, made in Melbourne,
Australia....What exactly is it, I hear you ask?Well, it is a Theremin, yes, but a Theremin of a special kind. If you
just think traditional theremin, you might be mistaken. This beautiful
Theremin is in a league of its own. To start with, it is a Theremin Midi
Controller, an ""invisible fader"" to control your synthesizer,
your sampler or just your keyboard, via Midi. By using CC messages
(Continuous Controller), pitch-bend messages or just note ON/OFF
messages, it enables  you to control your soft synth or your sampler by
just waving your hand in the air. This is very cool stuff and not only
does it look great on stage, it also allows you to be more expressive in
your performance. The Midi Wave Theremin opens up infinite possibilities
of computer sound manipulation and expression.Connecting a trigger pad to the Theremin turns the MWT-01 into a
percussion instrument not seen before. Load a simple snare sample into a
sampler and use the theremin pitch-bend mode to control the snare-pitch
via the antenna, for example. Setting the pitch-bend to several octaves
makes it possible to slow down the snare to a subsonic rumble, only to
be sped up again to sweep across the pitch spectrum to a high pitch
click... just by moving the left hand towards the antenna and the right
hand triggering the sample.For the drummer/percussionist: welcome to the world of virtual faders.
You can hold on to your drumstick and manipulate your drum samples just
by moving your hand near the theremin antenna. This will add another
dimension to your repertoire.But this is only a small part of what this ""thing"" is capable
of. One very unique feature is the implementation of a vintage ladder
style 24 dB resonant filter, which turns this Theremin into something
like a mini-synth. The filter frequency is accurately controlled via the
theremin antenna (very nice and superfast). The filter input can come
from an external signal source (sampler, synth or PC, etc.) or you can
use the internal oscillators (square, saw, triangle) to feed the filter
input. The three filter outputs (HP, BP, LP) can be mixed freely. Each
output has volume and pan control to create an interesting and dynamic
stereo output mix. From a Theremin controlled 24dB resonant filter, to
the weird and exotic world of ring modulation, crackle and noise
generation, this Theremin is full of inspiring possibilities to bring
fresh perspective to your music.And of course last, but not least, it is a stereo Theremin with three
oscillators (volume and pan for each), a wide selection of different
waveforms, from sine wave to various theremin waves, to triangle, saw and
square wave. Tremolo and a VCA (external volume control) are included
and a host of other features.",

What the Neuron actually does is it analyzes audio files (samples) and creates digital computer models of these sounds which can then be re-synthesized and processed using the extensive amount of on-board data-wheels and joysticks with control of more 'musical' sonic aspects such as instrument shape, size and acoustic behavior. The joysticks allow for real-time tweaking of up to three parameters at once - 3D modeling in a true 5.1 surround sound environment. The Neuron shipped with 200 modeled sounds already in its memory, but using their proprietary software application, ModelMaker (Mac/Win) a user can add their own sampled sounds to be modeled by the Neuron's neural network, and these can be stored in the user memory banks (sounds could be brought into the Neuron via analog, S/PDIF or USB connections). Instead of oscillators, the Neuron uses Resynators, of which it has two. Each resynator holds a single model (you can freely assign any models in memory to each resynator to build your sound). Each resynator has a joystick that lets you adjust the 'scape' and the 'sphere' of the sound. 'Scape' refers to the generation properties of a sound (such as the excitation source in a real instrument), 'sphere' would contain all parameters referring to the properties of the resonating 'instrument' body. The Neuron's Blender function lets you mix the results of the two resynators in a variety of ways, including morphing and crossfading. It even lets you manipulate one resynator using another.The Silver section is the Neuron's filter and effects section. In addition to a multi-mode filter (24dB LP, 12dB LP, Bandpass), it offers two multi-effect processors (time-based FX like chorus, flange, delay and frequency-based FX such as phaser, distortion, compressor, limiter). You can use this section's joystick to adjust multiple parameters in real-time, like filter cutoff and resonance at the same time. The Slicer section is a type of 3D LFO, affecting Resynator 2 or the Silver section. The Mod section is another more traditional LFO with 12 wave shapes, routable to many destinations in the Neuron. Envelope generators offer three ADSR-type EGs per resynator, an ADSR amp envelope and a user-definable EG.The Neuron's joysticks could also have their movements recorded so that their effect could become a part of the sound you are designing, further enabling you to create truly animated, swirling and moving sounds. To really get the most out of this, the Neuron also provided six freely definable audio outputs, which could be used in a true 5.1 surround sound format, and yes your sounds could be designed to swirl and sweep through the full surround environment. This made the Neuron very appealing to film composers like Hans Zimmer and innovative electronic musicians such as BT and The Arcane Paradigm.In the end, the Hartmann Neuron story is like so many others in the synthesizer industry, of those that have come and gone. The Neuron is an amazing instrument and defines an entirely new take on synthesis and sound design. However, its incredibly steep initial retail price of about $5,000 and the fact that it turned out to be quite a tough synth to operate due to the limited display capabilities*, the instrument just did not sell well and by 2005 Hartmann and the Neuron went out of business. The Neuron is now a hard-to-find but special instrument, capable of awesome and often unpredictable results.*Note: While we may have said the Neuron is difficult to use, we simply mean in terms of deliberate sound design. The Neuron is itself a beautiful machine with a very clean and logically laid-out control panel. The interface is incredibly tactile with mushroom shaped joysticks, pentagonal rotary knobs, a great 61 note keyboard and all ins/outs connectors located on one side of the instrument. It really is a pleasure to play with, but the difficulty is in understanding how to deliberately create a specific sound. More often than not users just play with the joysticks and knobs and wait and see what kind of sounds emerge. Only little LED bar graphs indicate what the on-board controllers are set to or doing.It should also be noted that the Neuron makes unusual use of the USB port. It cannot connect to a computer USB port. Instead, a USB to Ethernet adapter must be connected to the Neuron, and the adapter connected to the computer with a twisted pair Ethernet cable. There may have been an interface provided by Hartmann originally, but second hand units never appear to have an adapter included, although any commercially available adapter appears sufficient. It is possible to open the Neuron and connect its computer motherboard directly to another computer using a USB bridge cable or by Ethernet to a home network or to another computer directly using a twisted pair Ethernet cable, but this would allow communication only with the Neuron's Linux operating system, not with the synthesizer portion of the Neuron. It appears it was unfeasible to design the Neuron audio card with Ethernet built in, thus limiting it to USB connectivity while still requiring Ethernet protocol as its only means of communication. The exact reasoning for this decision has not yet been discovered.A software instrument version, the Neuron VS came out (2005) which offered everything the keyboard version did except for the 5.1 surround sound support and the master multi-effects section. It came with a mini USB-Neuron controller with one joystick and four rotary knobs. But it too, was expensive, for a soft-synth, at a $900 retail price. Definitely a more affordable way to get the unique sounds and experience of the Neuron synth, but like it's hardware counter-part, the Neuron VS is also a discontinued product.",

It is a 24-voice synthesizer (the NL2 is 16-voice) with many new
features including many bigger knobs and controls. A new Unison mode is
available that won't affect polyphony so that you can get some extremely
thick and fat polyphonic sounds. A new and 'easier to use' user
interface with endless rotary knobs and LED graphs offer total and
immediate control.The oscillator section has been completely redesigned. There are two
separate oscillator groups, each providing you with six different
waveforms, plus an additional built-in sync oscillator. A new type of
synthesis akin to FM is also available called Sinus Modulation (SM). The
Nord Lead 3 also features two high quality multi-mode filters with Low-,
Band- and High-pass filtering. There's also Lowpass-Highpass and
Lowpass-Lowpass filter modes and a Classic mode that emulates the
characteristics of a classic analog filter. The Nord Lead 3 now offers
up to 3 LFOs/Envelopes per voice plus Global Vibrato, syncable to MIDI
clock.The Nord Lead 3 also has four separate Morph groups. The Morph function
lets you continuously control defined ranges of up to 26 parameters in a
sound, using only a single control source. This lets you produce radical
changes to a sound in a very fast and easy way. There are four Morph
groups available for each sound and you may assign up to 26 different
parameters, distributed as you wish among the four Morph groups. The
Morph groups are hardwired to one control source each: Velocity,
Aftertouch, Modulation Wheel and Expression Pedal. And with the new
Timbre function you can switch between two complete parameter setups in
a sound.Also on-board are 4 individual audio outputs. Each MIDI part can be
routed to a separate output or to two for stereo. The Software within
the Nord Lead 3 can easily be upgraded via MIDI for future enhancements
and upgrades. The Nord Lead 3 makes a great synth better than ever! A
Nord Rack 3 is planned for release later this year. The Nord Lead 3 has
already been used by Jean-Michel Jarre, Stereolab, Adrian Belew, the

massive Nord Modular system. Like the Nord
Modular, a PC computer is used to virtually patch, tweak, edit and
design your synth patches in a modular fashion. However the stand-alone
keyboard interface has been replaced here by the very small four-knobbed
Micro Modular interface. The software is the exactly the same as the
original however the controller itself which houses DSP power is
considerably less than that of the original - reducing this units
polyphony from 32 to 4 voices or less and multitimbrality has been
stripped away. Software version 2.1 adds many new features including a
Ring Modulator, 14-Band FilterBank, Vocal Filter, FM Sine wave,
Digitizer (bare-bones sampling) and many more tricks.After you've created a patch using the software you can load it into one
of 99 memories within the controller. It can then be used live or in a
MIDI studio as a synth module. The simplified controller has a volume
knob and 3 other knobs that can be assigned editable parameters. Limited
as this might appear, you still get one of the biggest and most powerful
modular synthesizer emulator programs in the world. The Micro Modular

powerful one that graphically shows you a the modules you want and is
where you graphically make patches between modules and synthesize a
sound. It features over 100 modules! It's true modular synthesis meets
computer synthesis. It sounds awesome too! The keyboard still has MIDI
to be controlled and sequenced from your standard sequencer. The
programs you create in the editor can be stored on the computer or in
one of the 100 memories in the keyboard. Once you've created a sound you
can quit the editor program and use the keyboard controller stand-alone.The keyboard has multiple outputs, pedal input, has a very easy and
intuitive layout and a nice LCD screen. It also features a very good
sequencer! The Nord Modular system is expensive but it's like a Nord Lead 2 on steroids and without limits! If
you're not interested in the keyboard, a desktop/rack-mount version was
also available.Software version 2.1 adds many new features including a Ring

synthesizer. It was included as the third manual on many different
Wurlitzer home organ models since its introduction in 1971 (models 4037,
4373, 4573, 555 and others). It has a basic envelope that includes
attack and sustain, a filter of sorts (called ""wah-wah"" - guess what
kind of sound it makes), and an LFO (called ""modulator"" in Wurlitzer
parlance). The LFO has settings for rate and ""deviation"" (depth). The
""second touch"" feature is a crude aftertouch function, which you can
assign to affect either the LFO or the ""slide"" function. Each synthesis
function can be completely toggled on and off via push button. The sound
of the synth is modified by a row of organ-style buttons that affect the
timbre and the range.The rest of the instrument the Orbit III is attached to is classic
home organ fare. Cheesy drum beats, the usual home organ sounds, and a
cassette player/recorder round out the features of the organs that
typically contain an Orbit III. And lurking beneath the three manuals is
a real life rotating speaker cabinet. The early models used the
Wurlitzer Spectratone speaker, but switched over to the Leslie speaker
in 1974 with the model 555. Additional features included a volume pedal
and a foot manual (again, classic home organ features).Typically these organs were used in churches and schools. They are of
considerable weight, and as a result they can often be had for the cost
of sweat equity alone. You're not going to be picking up a secret
low-cost Moog, but you'll have a lot of fun with it once you get it

Synthesiser Company (OSC). It came in 1983 and though it was in the same
class as the Arp Odyssey and Minimoog mono-synths, its late arrival
makes it one of the more advanced programmable mono-synths of its time!
It's got a really cool sound, digitally controlled dual oscillators with
analog filters, and plenty of programmability all packed into a quirky
little plastic case with 37 keys. MIDI also appeared on later revisions
as well.Its sound starts out from its two DCO's. The synth is monophonic but
can also achieve duophonic capability when using just one oscillator per
voice. Waveforms offered include sawtooth, triangle, and square-,
variable-, or modulated-pulse waveforms. In addition to these analog
waveforms, there's an additive-synthesis function allowing you to create
your own custom waveforms by simply mixing the amplitudes of any of its
24 harmonics using the keyboard. Up to 24 of these custom waves can be
stored and used with either oscillator.Once you've got some sounds it's time to hit the filter section - the
real analog heart of this synth! It has two 12dB/oct filters which can
be linked for a steeper 24dB/oct slope. It features switchable lowpass,
highpass and bandpass filtering and your basic frequency cutoff and
resonance type controls. The filter has its own ADSR envelope as well (a
second ADSR envelope controls the amplifier section). The filter can
also be modulated by the LFO. The OSCar's LFO offers triangle, sawtooth,
square, and other wave shapes and can also be used to modulate the amp,
pitch, or pulse-width. There's even a sample-and-hold function.A simple built-in sequencer gave the OSCar duophonic capabilities! It
could play a sequence on one of the oscillators while the keyboard can
be used to simultaneously play along with the sequence. It stores up to
24 sequences. When MIDI came on later models after 1984, you could
easily synchronize your OSCar and other MIDI gear together and patches
stored in memory could be dumped via MIDI to more permanent offline
storage mediums. MIDI models also offered 36 programmable memory patches
which are assigned to the actual keyboard keys (pre-MIDI models had 12
preset and 24 user patches). The OSCar is usually hard to find and they
usually need some work (they're almost 20 years old), but it's a
favorite and classic little beast which has been used by Hardfloor,
Orbital, Ozric Tentacles, BT, Jean-Michel Jarre, Asia, Ultravox, Stevie
Wonder, Sneaker Pimps, Keith Emerson, Sneaker Pimps, and

It was designed by brothers Al and Bob Gleeman and featured three DCOs for a stable
and juicy analog sound. The Pentaphonic was in the running against such classics as
the Sequential Prophet-5, Moog Minimoog and Polymoog, and the Oberheim 4-Voice.
But the Gleeman Pentaphonic (and the Pentaphonic Clear) are extremely rare!
Only about 30 Pentaphonics and 20 Pentaphonic Clears were ever made.In addition to three oscillators per voice, the Pentaphonic has a four-pole
lowpass resonant filter with an ADSR envelope, a VCA with ADSR, an LFO, and
built-in chorusing (slow or fast). There is also a handy 300-note capacity
sequencer on-board for simple real-time recordings that you can play along with.
There's also a cool X/Y joystick for controlling pitch and mod effects.
Some models also had a Presetter added which gave it 100 patch memories
and eight digital waveforms.The Clear model is unique because of its transparent plexiglass case. It was also designed to
be strapped on like a guitar for live use. The standard models had a boring black case
and a built-in speaker. Their demise has been blamed on the rise of the digital revolution as led by the Yamaha DX7.
They went out of production in 1983, but the Audities Foundation
had bought, restored and built some since. Audities-built Clear versions have green circuit boards. 
They have been used by Moog Cookbook, Imperial Drag, and Alabama.

striking feature, the built-in cassette deck. This allowed you to save
your compositions as either sound or data, or it could function as a

white.The main voice is monophonic, with simple preset accompaniment rhythms
(with 15 options for the rhythm's voice) controlled by the 'Gling'
safe-note system. This heavily limits its potential as a solo
instrument, not only because the beats are laughably thin but because
the accompanying voices are fixed in their patterns.There are 100 preset melody voices, mostly the standard
Yamaha PortaSound two-op noises, but
there's also a surprising amount of useable sound effects and slow,
evolving (but moving in very obvious digital steps) pads. It's charming

visualized on an LCD screen in full stave notation with rock-steady
tempo, adjustable to insane degrees! Notes can be edited in or out of
the sequence at will. If this thing had MIDI out it would have become a
cult classic.Sadly, though, it was a flop in terms of sales. It's not that hard to
understand why; even by the mid-eighties this thing would have been
considered comical and there's little hope of understanding the
architecture without a manual. Still, it's a great curio to have in any

each with triangle, square, saw, two types of pulse waveforms and one
noise generator, the levels of which are controlled via the internal
mixer. Although the oscillators can become unstable and difficult to
tune, the Polivoks is well suited for making screeching sounds and
thunderous bass. You can also connect an external audio input for
processing through the Polivoks' switchable dual-mode band pass/low
pass filter and LFO sections. The LFO, or ""Modulator"" offers triangle,
square, random and noise waveshapes and can be applied to the oscillator
level and pitch or the filter cutoff. There are also two ADSR envelopes
for contouring the oscillators and filters.Polivoks had been produced since 1982 by the Formanta electronic
factory (one of the biggest at the time); it was sold exclusively in the
USSR. Polivoks has its own unique electronic components including a
reliable keyboard (49 notes F to E) made with magnetically controlled
contacts and DIN sockets for its three outputs and one input. Its synthesis modules consist of independent circuit boards,
which is convenient for maintenance and repair. In addition, Polivoks is

controls.One more thing though, if you come across one of these it helps if

powerful virtually analog synthesizer that assumes an evolved form and
purpose of its breakthrough hit predecessor - the RaveOLution 309! First the sounds: the
PolyMorph is basically four synths loaded with synth and drum sounds
geared towards electronica and other forms of synthesizer music.
Individual ADSR's and filters per oscillator make for a totally
tweakable and flexible synthesizer. The sequencer: 16 step, 8
variations, 4 parts or instruments. Parts and even notes can be muted or
changed in real time to build and decompose your grooves or synth
textures. There are also preset phrase patterns to play around with.Aside from sounding quite nice, the PolyMorph is beefed up by a great
set of effects. Add distortion, EQing, reverb, chorus, flange, etc. to
each of the four parts independently! The controls, knobs and sequencer
can all be controlled via MIDI for in-studio use, however the impressive
multi-effects implementation alone is a major hint that the PolyMorph is
a machine suited for live, DJ and on the fly music production. The
PolyMorph is for those of you looking to create synth music from a
stand-alone box that is not entirely focused on dance. It is used by
Orbital, Jean-Michel Jarre and
the Prodigy.",

The 309 is very intuitive and easy to get started using. Play with the
patterns or make your own. All real-time tweaks can be recorded into
your sequence for later playback!The 5 part multitimbral feature is the secret to this units power for
live and interactive performances. The 5 separate parts are Kick,
Snares, Hi-Hats, percussion and bass synth. During your performance you
can mute any of these parts to drop the beat or isolate the kick, thus
building or lowering the groove and your audiences energy! A plethora of
knobs offer quick and easy access to filter and envelope modulation for
shaping and morphing the music. The 309 is also well suited for studio
work with complete MIDI implementation that includes all real-time
controls and knobs.The 309 is truly an instant dance machine! It sounds great for analog
emulation synthesis! It looks pretty cool and comes from a company that
knows all about Trance and Techno music. The Rave-O-Lution 309 is an
obvious choice for anybody seriously looking to get into dance music
with an affordable all-in-one box that will grow and remain useful in
your studio and music for as long as techno is still around! It has been used
by Apollo 440, Nine Inch Nails, and KMFDM.There have been three expansions for the Rave-O-Lution 309 since it was
released. The Audio expansion added two audio inputs and two more audio
outputs. The Drum expansion added a bunch of new drum and percussion
samples plus midi synced LFO's. The synth expansion added a second
bass/lead synth (though it requires the audio expansion and they do not
have their own 'part' buttons).",

rack-mountable synth, the ""MASS"" engine Quasar. The Quasar was
a do-it-all multitimbral unit that was quite powerful, but had a rather
lacking overall sound. The single-unit-high silver-clad Technox is a
vast improvement based upon the Raven engine,
though it's still a mid-90s ROMpler and so playing many sounds at the
highest or lowest octaves brings out tell-tale artifacts.But what are those sounds? Well the phrase ""techno rave
electronic"" on the fascia would probably hint at what one would
find, and indeed the presets are utterly 90's techno, rave, IDM,
electronica goodness from every pore. Lots of pretty solid basses, rave
leads, hooverish sounds, acid squeals, spacey pads and some great drum
kits. The latter includes full sets of
TR-808, 909 and
606 hits. There are 512 presets, which for a
1995 synth wasn't bad!Whereas the Quasar excelled at providing a ton of bread-and-butter
sounds, the Technox is oriented towards dance musicians. To this end, a
sequencer is also included which can address up to 16 MIDI parts. Each
part has its own level, pan and effects send, and much more besides.
Using this and editing in general is a touch fiddly with the two knobs
and four buttons, paired to a 2-line 16-character dot matrix LCD. But it
isn't difficult, and while the presets tend to cover early-90s techno, a
touch of editing can go a long way into many other genres. There's a lot
of good stuff here for darker and ambient genres!There's only stereo outs, but full MIDI In/Out/Thru and a foot switch
jack. The Technox's greatest asset, ultimately, is its 16-part
multitimbrality. Channel 10 is fixed to addressing drums, but the other
15 channels can go where you want. There are only 14 memories for these
multitimbral setups, though, which is a touch limiting.One aspect of these Quasimidi synths that throw some off is their sound
creation, or rather the lack of. Similar to the Quasar, it isn't really
possible to build sounds from scratch. Instead you use the preset
samples and alter their settings using offset values. But where the
Quasar had difficulty sounding anything more than ""slightly
muffled"", the Technox's samples are higher quality and at least
provide better starting points.Don't expect anything close to a raw analog sound, or the sheen of a
Korg workstation. While the Technox can sound a touch thin when playing
single voices, a few of them mixed together can sound a lot beefier.
There's a ton of good sounds in the Technox, and it is still very
useable in many electronic music genres. They're not easy to find, but
not all that expensive either. Not outstanding, but definitely worth a
listen!",

It had a fully polyphonic 4 octave keyboard, controlling what EMS called a Voltage Controlled Oscillator Bank (VCOB), but only 1 VCA and one filter switchable for 2 pole (12db) or 4 pole (24db) operation was available for all the voices, therefore the instrument was really 'para-phonic,' like some of its contemporaries such as the Korg Delta.However, the Polysynthi had a few cool tricks up its sleeve that make it stand out.  To begin with, it had two voltage controlled LFO's (VCLFO) with sine and variable pulse waveforms which could modulate each other or be frequency modulated by either of the 2 ADSR's.  Furthermore, they could trigger the ADSR's allowing the performer to disconnect the keyboard from VCA duties to use it to control other parameters such as the filter or the delay time of the voltage controlled analog delay line.  The VC ""analog delay line"" was perhaps the most novel feature of the Polysynthi.  One switch selected between the short delay mode (for effects such as chorus or flanging or reverb) and the long delay mode, for echoes up to 1 second.  Since the delay time could be controlled by the keyboard voltage and by the VCLFO, a large range of time-based FX was easily created.  The EMS Polysynthi sound sources were two VCO's (or Voltage Controlled Oscillator Bank, 49 notes polyphony) producing triangle, square and pulse waveforms which could be independently mixed, a noise generator and external input (switchable between line and mic) with envelope follower.   Its 4 octaves pressure sensitive keyboard, besides pitch information supplied a pressure-dependent control voltage and a position dependent control voltage.  The back panel supplied control voltage inputs for filter, pitch bend and VCA (swell) and the ""sequencer option"" connection.  The latter was for connection to the planned optional polyphonic sequencer, which never evolved past the prototype stage.  Coming at the end of the era of the 'classical' analog synths, it was hard for the EMS Polysynthi to leave a mark in synth history.Its features, namely being para-phonic, made it impossible to compare with other great poly synths available at the time such as Roland Juno 6, Oberheim OB X, Sequential Prophet 5.  It was perhaps meant more as a live performance special fx machine (in this perhaps a true descendant of the VCS3), but its control panel ergonomics, based on ""switch busses"" were not as easily grasped by musicians, and the delay line -however ingenious- could not compete in sound quality with the then popular great tape echoes, with the result that the overall sound of the Polysynthi was more roughened  than enhanced by it.  Overall this huge and colorful instrument suffered most of the change in musical aesthetics brought by the incipient 80's.  A similar change in musical aesthetics makes this rare beast a sought after sound maker.",

the same electronic instrument as the EMS VCS3, except that the Synthi models are
housed in a thin plastic briefcase for easy portability. The
Synthi A was also commonly known as the ""Portabella"". The AKS model (pictured below) adds a 
256-step on-board monophonic digital sequencer and a 30-note touchplate
keyboard (activated by the 50 Hz-hum in our fingers).Like the VCS3, the Synthi A and AKS feature three oscillators and a unique patch system. Instead of patch
wires, they use a patchbay grid wherein the synth components are
laid out and signal routing is accomplished by placing small pins into
the appropriate slots. The VCS3/Synthi was, in actuality, a modular type
synthesizer reduced down to an extremely portable size.Synthi AKSThey are famous for their ability to generate those familiar sci-fi sounds (Dr. Who) and other uniquely analog
sounds. After ten minutes of warm-up the oscillators become pretty stable.
There's a Noise Generator, two Input Amplifiers, one Ring Modulator, one
Voltage Controlled Low Pass Filter (VCF), one Trapezoid Envelope
Generator, a Joy-Stick Controller, a Voltage Controlled Spring Reverb unit
and two Stereo Output Amplifiers.What is important about the portable line of EMS synths is that they
were super miniaturized and fairly sophisticated for their time. The
patching grid system made patching easier, and allowed the unit to take
up a lot less space. The Synthi A was released in 1971, two years after the
launch of the VCS3 (The AKS came out in 1972). It should be noted that the case mounting of the AKS
can be very precarious. The mounting is prone to fail, and therefore any
used units should be examined carefully to see if this common problem
exists before buying.Synthi 100EMS also produced the monsterous Synthi 100 in 1971. It
is loosely based around the combination of three VCS3 systems into one massive synthesizer.
Although the circuit boards are unique and somewhat different, the filters
are still quite similar to those of the VCS3 and A/AKS. The sound
of the Synthi 100 was subtly distinct from the VCS3. Both filters and
oscillators were much more stable in the Synthi 100. It featured twelve
VCOs, two keyboards and a 3-track, 256-step monophonic digital sequencer.
EMS really was an early pioneer of digital sequencers in a time when such devices
as Moog's analog 10-step sequencer were the more popular norm. The Synth 100 also featured two
massive 64 x 64 patch matrices. Approximately 29 Synthi 100 systems were built in
the 1970s and early 80s, although EMS still states that you can have one built
as a special order. It sold for $25,000 originally, and probably still
does today. Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto owns one which he used heavily on his
album, ""R.U.O.K?"".Synthi EThe Synthi E is an educational form of the Synthi that had a
complete teaching course built around it for use in colleges and
schools. It was intended as a teaching aid into the principles of sound
synthesis and electronic music. Small, housed in a brief-case and
battery powered, the Synthi E was perfect for the student or teacher on
the go! Simple as it may appear, it actually has some sophistiated
features:Many of these EMS synth's have been used by Brian Eno, Pink Floyd,
Stereolab, Yes, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Jean-Michel Jarre, Astral
Projection, Vince Clarke, The Who, Todd Rundgren, Recoil, Freddy Fresh,
Ultravox and many more.",

released in 1971 as a stand-alone version of what was essentially the same
digital sequencer found in the monstrous Synthi 100.Undoubtedly the most advanced sequencer of its time, the Sequencer 256
featured analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters to enable digital
processing of the control voltages it uses to control other
analog synthesizers. The control voltages can be used with any analog
synthesizer—an offset control automatically sets the control
voltage to work with the likes of Arp, Moog, Sequential, and any other
CV/Gate equipped synthesizers.In an era when synthesizers and especially sequencers were often more
engineer-oriented rather than musician-oriented, the Sequencer 256
offered a very musician-friendly method of operation. It came enclosed
in a wooden case with a full 5-octave keyboard, and looks more like a
synthesizer than stand-alone sequencer. A sequence is created by
simply playing notes on the keyboard—just as we still do to this
day with MIDI-based sequencers. Up to 256 ""events"" could be stored. It
will then play back the stored sequence with the same timing, note and
note duration as originally performed. Even velocity could be stored, as
it stores two voltages per event: one for pitch and one for velocity. Of
course these control voltages could also be applied to other areas such
as filter cutoff.It also featured three Layers (aka tracks) for sequencing multiple
instruments at a time or multiple parameters of an instrument, essentially overdubbing. A
previously recorded track can be played back while recording on the next
track. Record a performance on one track, overdub some filter cutoff
moves on the second track, and add a backing part from another
instrument on the third, performing it all in real-time.Recorded sequences can be edited with sophistication as well. You can
essentially fast-forward or rewind through your sequences, or move step
by step. Zero-in on a note and it can be erased or modified. Changing a
note will not have any effect on any of the notes before or after it. A
special 4th track (or Layer) contains only pulse data that can be used for
special timing applications, like creating loops of parts of the
sequence, or providing clock to other external equipment.The question is, does anybody really need one of these today? Of
course not. But this is by now a rare 40-year old piece of vintage technology!
In an era where ""digital"" was not yet a household word, and
synthesizers seemed more like science experiments than musical
instruments, the Synthi Sequencer 256 broke the mold. Absolutely
state-of-the-art digital technology designed for a musician to
play with.",

and one major Con. The Pro, is that it sounds just about as good as you
can at totally reproducing the sound of the classic analog Pro One
monosynth from the old Sequential Circuits company. The Con, the Pro One
is a soft synth designed specifically for use with Creamware's Pulsar/Luna I/O
cards. Owners of such cards can get this plug-in for a mere $99! The rest
of use will have to shell out $452 for both the Pro One software synth and a Creamware
Luna DSP card (compatible with both Mac/PC). That said, the Pro One is a stunning replica, both in interface and
sounds! Every knob rotates, and every switch switches. No worrying about
sticky notes, dead switches or dirty pots! All those analog problems are
gone, except for that sound! But the designers could not resist, and
they added new features too, including polyphony, program memory, an
improved arpeggiator & step sequencer, and full MIDI control. The Pro
One software synth could be a must have product, if only it were not limited
to Creamware's DSP cards.This isn't any ordinary software synth. Wine Country Sequential has been preserving, restoring,
and servicing vintage Sequential Circuits equipment for years. The Pro One is called a
software survival kit. Its intention is to preserve the sound of the aged (1981) Pro One
mono synths for future generations of musicians. Because it was designed in conjunction
with John Bowen (former Sequential Prophet Team member) of Zarg Music who now designs
software synths for the Creamware DSP card, the Pro One is based on the DSP power of the
Creamware DSP cards, and may not (if ever) be available in other more native computer
plug-in formats. An original Pro One could be found for about the same price as 
this whole package. But with its authentic sound and new features...unless you're nostalgic,
go for the software survival kit!",

environment for your PC. The hardware component is a PCI board for PC devices and MAC.
The Pulsar DSP board brings it all together -
integrating mixing, effects, sampling and synthesis, all at the highest digital standards, 
in one ultra-powerful and compatible DSP environment. This works with
software integrating and giving you control of the
mixing, effects, sampling, synthesis, routing, automation and so much more!
And because it has 4 dedicated SHARC processors there is no audible
latency, and no power is drained from your host processor. For your external equipment, Pulsar functions
just like a mixer - with 20 channels input you can connect your external effects and your sampling and synthesis
hardware to Pulsar's I/Os and use them as inserts within the Pulsar environment.
Pulsar features 'total recall' for easy storage and retrieval of your set-ups and mixes.
The Pulsar is highly flexible and can function as a hub of your Midi studio
where every
driver, every physical I/O and every ""device"" (i.e. synths, effects etc.) is
represented as a module that has audio (and or MIDI) connections (""pads""). 
Every audio pad can connect to any other audio pad connecting the different pieces 
of gear you use in your studio setup. The Pulsar features a Modular Synthesizer section. It offers over 100 synth components or
modules that you can freely connect and interconnect to design your own sounds, with
virtually no limits! Patches for the Pulsar Modular can be saved and exchanged with other
Pulsar users. The modular elements include a sample player, inserts and the
Pulsar DSP effects. You can even use some Windows software source as an
oscillator element. The Pulsar ships with a bonus Waldorf 3rd party 
2-oscillator module using their famous wavetable synthesis.The Pulsar also features a professional quality digital sample player.
Load banks off of AKAI-compatible sound CDs with envelope
and filter settings from your CD-ROM drive of your computer. It
has a filter section, up to 64 stereo-voices and all the functionality
of a pro-sampler.Finally there is the 32-channel digital mixer. The mixer can be freely connected with other
modules - such as external audio sources (via the I/O input channels), Pulsar
software devices (e.g. a synth), or Windows software outputs (via virtual card
drivers). Each channel strip of the 32 channels has 4-band parametric EQ, four Pulsar
effects inserts, and 8 auxiliary busses for internal or external effects. The
Mixer also has 16 record busses/subgroups allowing you to input the record signal
via your Windows software. The master section of the Pulsar mixer features
dithering to 16-bit. That helps to get your 24-bit productions down to 16 bit
while maintaining the quality advantage.",

the originals (without the noise, static and crackles that the analog
circuitry generated). Each 303, 808 or 909 can store 32 patterns and
each pattern length is variable from 1 to 16 steps. All the same edit
knobs from the originals are here and can be recorded into your songs in
real-time! There are also distortion, compression, panning, delay
effects and a PCF filter.Programming patterns into each section is almost as faithful a
reproduction of the originals as is their appearance. Only one Song or
Mix can be created at a time, however all parameter tweaks, effect
changes, pattern changes and so on can be recorded to the song in real
time or in step mode. ReBirth is without a doubt the most intuitive,
classic, realistic and faithful emulation of classic Roland gear with
amazing flexibility and tonal control. Although ReBirth may be best
suited for Acid-House music production, amateurs and professionals alike
are already using ReBirth for extra and easy 303 lines, drum beats or
entire tracks! ReBirth is compatible with most current sequencers via
MIDI sync. An added bonus to ReBirth is a quasi-open architecture that
allows users to revamp the graphics and drum samples to create their own

drum machine ever produced.  Only around ten were made by Harry
Chamberlin from his Upland, California garage back in 1949.  Some have
said that the Wurlitzer Sideman was the first drum machine, but
Chamberlin's invention preceded it by ten years.The Rhythmate uses a 1"" magnetic tape loop which is read by a tape head
that can be moved up or down to play back 14 separate drum patterns. 
The tempo is adjusted by moving a spindle up or down which affects the
speed of the tape moving across the head.  The Rhythmate has a built-in
amplifier and 12"" speaker.In 1951, Harry Chamberlin used his idea of magnetic tape playback
(samples) to create the Chamberlin Model 200 keyboard.  The Model
300/350, 400, 500 and 600/660 models followed.In the mid 1960's, Harry's concept was used by Mellotronics to create
their now famous line of Mellotron keyboards.  Mellotronics did not ask

happy about it.  But they agreed to pay Harry $30,000 in compensation,

It comes with 2 modules pre-installed left of the keyboard, the RS-330 Keyboard Controller and RS-220 X/Y Controller. It also has MIDI and standard 1V/octave CV jacks for external control. Since the modules use CV (control voltages), incoming/outgoing MIDI is converted to/from CV. The MIDI response is noticeably less than instantaneous, but the built-in keyboard (which uses CV itself) is quick, responsive and light to the touch. Every Sorcerer is unique since you decide which modules you want to install in it. Analogue Systems offers a full range of excellent modules and the Sorcerer is compatible with Doepfer's A-100 line of synth modules as well. Analogue Systems has even gone so far as to create replicas of classic Moog, EMS, and Bode filters and effects. You can even get Moog or ARP 2500 style knobs on your modules if you choose. Plop 3 VCO modules and their Moog filter into the Sorcerer and you've got yourself a convincing Minimoog! Each module is easily added/replaced and internally connected via 16-pin ribbon cable.Creating sounds is pure analog heaven. You have to patch audio and CV from module to module to generate, control and (hopefully) create sounds. It uses 1/8"" jacks for patching. Successfully creating sounds can pose a challenge but the results can be very rewarding. Here's a list of the modules Analogue Systems offers: Although the Sorcerer system makes for a classy and powerful performance synth, there are other cabinet options available as well. There is the RS-Integrator series (pictured above). It contains models such as the RS-10 and RS-15 rackmounts and the larger 8500 series walnut cabinet systems. All are waiting to be filled up with the modules of your choosing. The Apprentice for $600 is a keyboard-less Sorcerer. The Demon is a stand-alone 49-note keyboard controller with built in MIDI/CV converter, joystick and portamento, single and multiple triggering that can be used with many compatible analog synths (Moog, ARP, Roland and others).

There
were a number of such keyboards around at the time and earlier,
including Roland's SH-2000 and the ARP
Pro Soloist. They gave quick access to
generic sounds, and were often designed to sit atop another keyboard,
such as an organ.A quick glance at the 32 sounds on offer might turn away those raised
on modern Virtual Analogs with 1000 memories: tuba, flute, Hawaiian
guitar, whistle…and yet, this is a surprisingly well-featured and
useful little synth that still deserves a place in amongst its bigger,
cleverer, more expensive brethren.Teisco equipment can also be found under the label Kawai – the
latter company bought the former and took some time to change the brand
name. The Kawai model has a wood-effect front lower panel surround where
the Teisco is all metal, but otherwise the two are identical. They
originally came with a music stand that slots into two holes on the top;
they are 37-key, C-C; they have 32 preset sounds that are selected using
switches beneath the keyboard, and a left-hand control panel that sports
basic performance features.The sounds themselves are a mixed bag. Realism is not the 100P's
strong point – bassoonists can sleep easy, and the monophonic
piano seems slightly pointless – but many of them are a pleasure
to play, and several are pretty usable. The bass sounds possess a solid
low end, the shakuhachi is smooth and effective, and the four ""synthe""
sounds have a pleasing rawness. The limited tweaking afforded by the
panel controls includes a clumsy pitch-bend slider, filter ""brilliance"",
and modulation rate, as well as octave up/down, portamento (and
glissando) time, tune, volume and three keyboard triggering modes.Perhaps the most unexpected and interesting aspects of this modest
little synth are its built-in reverb and assignable aftertouch. Reverb
is of the spring type, with an effect level knob on the panel;
aftertouch also has a sensitivity control knob to suit your playing, and
can be routed simultaneously to several destinations, including pitch
bend up/down, filter, vibrato amount and ""growl"". The degree of
flexibility this adds to the otherwise simple sounds makes this synth
much more expressive than many more patchable monos of the time. There
is also an ""effects"" section allowing the switching of porta/glissando,
hold/sustain, note repeat and – another nice feature – a
flanger.There is minimal interfacing here: high and low outputs, headphone
jack, and an expression pedal input for volume control – but the
advantage of this is that the 100P begs to be played. Forget your
CV/Gate, your MIDI and USB – forget how many demisemiquavers you
can quantize at 300BPM – flex your finger joints and have some
fun!NOTE: The underside of the S100P bears a sticker labelled
""Manufactured under license from ARP Instruments Inc, USP 3,965,789"".
This refers to the ""Electronic Musical Instrument Effects Control""
– the aftertouch.",

synthesizer released in 1984 as a follow up to the Kawai SX-210. It was manufactured by Kawai but originally released under
the Teisco brand-name in Japan when Kawai bought out Teisco. The Kawai
SX-240 and the Kawai SX-210 never got much attention due to entering
the market during the time of the digital revolution and poor
marketing. Its main analog competitors of the time were the Korg Polysix and the Roland Juno 6/60.Being among the first in the era of MIDI, its MIDI implementation
is very basic and it receives on all channels. In terms of patch
editing, the SX-240 is very much like a Roland Alpha Juno or Moog Source which resort to using a dedicated
data-wheel to edit the values of selected parameters. Four scroll
buttons allow you to select the parameter you wish to edit. All the
parameters have an LED light on the right hand side of the face of the
SX-240 to make it very easy to see what you're editing, though only
one parameter can be edited at a time. Saving your edited sounds is
very easy thanks to a huge LCD display and using the keys of the
keyboard to type the name of your edited sound alphanumerically.The SX-240 has a big, wide and full analog sound, courtesy of its
two analog DCOs and one sub-osc per voice. You have the options of
poly-8, poly-4 and mono modes. In mono mode it is possible to have all
24 oscillators stacked into one for an extremely powerful sound.
Leads, basses, brass, drones, pads and strings all have a unique
analog sound on the SX-240. Strings and pads get especially warm and
fluid when switching on the Ensemble effect, which is just a chorus.
The SX-240 also has a function called Brass, which is actually a
ring-mod effect.Modulation possibilities are somewhat limited due to having just
one saw wave on DCO1, but with adjustable PW and PWM plus a noise generator, you can find some
great sound possibilities. The LFO can be routed everywhere in the
DCO, VCF and the VCA. It also has an LFO trigger button to start or
stop the LFO on command. The SX-240 uses eight SSM 2044 filter chips
which help make up its powerful filter sound. The filter also
strangely jumps into self oscillation around the value point of 98 to
99. There are also both portamento and glissando, though it was
uncommon to find both of these effects on synths of the time.The SX-240 also has the option of being placed in Split or Dual
modes. In Split mode you can assign two patches to be played in a
split on the keyboard. In Dual mode two patches can be played at the
same time for a rich, warm, and layered sound. It also has a built-in,
real time 1,500 note sequencer and chord memory.The SX-240 is often said to sit somewhere in between the Polysix
and the Juno 6/60 in terms of sound. While that could be a generally
true statement, the fact is the SX-240 does not sound like either of
them, but rather has its own unique analog sound. It's also pretty
rare today. Most found second hand have NI-Cad battery issues causing
a common symptom of not being able to retain saved patches to memory.
This battery must be replaced or modified to a Li-Ion battery to
ensure a long life for the SX-240. Even without showing any symptoms,
it's best to have the Ni-Cad looked at for possible leakage.",

producing home organs and semi-professional accompaniment keyboards. But
they also made a few attempts at producing professional music
workstations. The first of them was the S-Series, introduced in 1992.
GEM called it the ""Music Processor"" because of its many advanced
functions, including a powerful sequencer, the ability to read and edit
samples, excellent real-time controllers, and many others.In 1993, GEM upgraded the S-Series with the so-called ""Turbo kit""
which allowed for many new functions and doubled the polyphony. The
Turbo kit was also sold separately as an upgrade for the original
models. GEM also released a rack version, called the S2R, with the Turbo
upgrade already installed.There were two original models, with only one difference between
them: S2 and S3. The S2 has a 61-note keyboard and the S3 has a 76-note
keyboard. Both keyboard models have excellent semi-weighted keys with
touch/release velocity, polyphonic aftertouch and metal contacts. On the
front panel, there are also seven programmable sliders, seven
programmable buttons and Pitch and Modulation wheels. All functions are
logically and clearly displayed on a large graphical LCD with light blue
neon back-lighting. Thanks to the excellent hardware and also thanks to
two MIDI I/O's, the S2/S3 is an ideal master keyboard for the home
studio.GEM S3The S-Series can do excellent analog
synthesizer emulations, impressive textures, punchy basses, synth
strings & brass, and also a very nice emulation of tone-wheel
organs. The acoustic sounds are rather obsolete in comparison to newer
instruments, but some of them are still very nice (i.e. Pan Flute).The synthesizer engine is 16-note polyphonic (32 on Turbo models).
The sound structure is similar to older Korg models: Two oscillators per
voice (the Turbo models can also use one oscillator per voice, but with
some limitations) which can use one (or two on Turbo models) of the 209
waveforms included in ROM or any of the multisamples loaded into RAM.
There are two excellent 12 dB/Oct. resonant filters per voice which can
be independently set as: Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Parameter Cut, or
Parameter Boost. If the setting on both filters is exactly the same,
they work as one 24dB/Oct. filter! This allows the S2/S3 to make very
nice analog-like sweeps. Next, there are three 10-segment envelopes
(Amp, Filter, Pitch) with the ability to create a continuous loop on any
portion of the envelope. There is one LFO with Sine, Triangle, Saw,
Square, Random and S&H shapes, and a Panorama function with its own
additional envelope for stereo imaging.The sample edit function will read and edit samples in WAV, Akai and
AIFF formats loaded in from DOS-formatted floppy disks using a program
called ""Sample Translator"". The original S2/S3 instruments need to load
this program from a floppy disk into their (volatile) RAM. The Turbo
models have it pre-installed. The S-Series instruments have all the
basic editing functions of a sampler, including sample truncate,
normalize, loop, etc., and can build a multisample from up to 16 single
samples. Once the sample is created, it can be used in the same manner
as any of the sounds from the ROM. There are 2MB of RAM (volatile)
dedicated for samples.GEM S2RThe S-Series instruments are always in
Performance mode. The Performance can be made from up to 16 Sounds or
Patches (yes, you can control all 16 MIDI tracks from the keyboard!) and
the effects section settings. In the ROM of the instrument, there are
100 patches for Performances (Turbo models only) and they are
automatically loaded when the instrument is powered-up. The Turbo
versions shipped preloaded with 100 excellent performances including a
lot of textures, pads and leads.The effects section consists of two blocks. The first of them
includes different Reverb and Hall effects and a few Reverb/Delay
combination effects. The second block includes very good Choruses,
Flangers, Rotary Speaker simulations and some Pitch/Delay
combinations.The on-board Sequencer has all you need for serious music production.
Up to 250,000 notes capacity, Quantization, Macro edit, Undo/Redo,
Clipboard, Copy & Paste functions, and more. It can record all
realtime controller movements including the polyphonic aftertouch and it
can control two additional sound sources independently thanks to two
independent MIDI interfaces. There is another 2MB of RAM dedicated for
sequencer data. It can store 10 songs with 10 sequences per song. Again,
all functions of the sequencer are clearly displayed on the excellent
LCD. Although the instrument is not General MIDI (GM) compatible, the
sequencer can load/save and convert standard MIDI files.Data storage on the original non-Turbo models is done only via 3.5""
HD floppy disk with special 1.6 MB formatting. Everything included in
RAM (Samples, Sequencer Data, Sound and Effect Libraries, Performance
Data) erase after the instrument is switched-off. The Turbo models have
four slots for non-volatile SDRAM chips with a total capacity of 512 kB
or 2 MB. They behave like a small hard disk and once you have installed
these chips (called RAM-Disk) and stored your settings, the instrument
will reload them when you turn it on. Unfortunately, there is no data
output like a SCSI or serial interface.Overall, the S-Series is very reliable and of a solid build. The
keyboard feel and real-time control are excellent, as well as the
display and control panel layout. They also have great connectivity: Two
MIDI interfaces, two main and four auxiliary outputs, headphones output,
two programmable foot-switch inputs and one programmable pedal input.
This all make it ideal for use as a master keyboard in the home studio,
but the sounds are also very interesting. GEM also released a huge
library of sample, sound and song disks for this series.The succeeding generation of GEM's workstations, named Equinox
(1998), got huge improvements: 64 voice polyphony, arpeggiators, RAM
expansion up to 32 MB, etc. But it lost the excellent semi-weighted
keyboard, the polyphonic aftertouch, and that nice display was replaced
by dull, half-sized LCD. The Equinox was discontinued around 2004. GEM
continued making home and semi-professional keyboards and one high-end
accompaniment workstation called Genesys (which used many features from
the S-Series workstations) until the Generalmusic brand disappeared from
the market in 2008.The S2 has been used by Brian Eno.",

Adding to the computer's fame was the SID chip: an extremely powerful sound chip for its time, well beyond anything its competitors were producing. The SID chip is responsible for some of the most recognizable chip music ever produced.  Other synthesizers have harnessed the power of the SID chip (see the Elektron SIDstation), but none so completely as the MidiBox SID project. MidiBox is an open-source, modular approach to MIDI and synthesis, and the SID project is an engine designed to provide powerful access to the sound enervation capabilities of the SID.The sammichSID is a specific offshoot of the MidiBox SID, designed from the ground up to be distributed as a complete kit, simple enough for a beginner to build. It runs on two SID chips (as opposed to the single sound chip of the Commodore 64 computer), allowing for stereo operation. Instead of the half dozen or so PCBs one would need for a modular MidiBox SID, the sammichSID is two PCBs that fit together inside a custom case.Onto the synthesis: each chip has three independent voices and one analog filter. The Midibox software allows for very powerful access to all six voices: it can be set up as a monster monosynth, a six voice polyphonic synth, or any number of synced or ring-modulated combinations of oscillators. There is an extremely powerful modulation matrix, arpeggiator, TB-303-like bassline sequencer and drum sequencer.The kits are no longer available, but completed specimens are often up for sale on the secondhand market. At about a third (or less) of the price of a SIDstation and many times more powerful, this is one of the definitive SID synths.",

It's a
software-based sample player that operates as a VST, DXi, RTAS, MAS and
Audio Units plug-in under Mac OS and Windows operation systems. It ships
with a library of about 4.5 GigaBytes of sampled sounds including Bass,
Brass, Drums, Ethnic, Guitars, Loops, Orchestral, Organs, Percussion,
Piano, Strings, Synths, Vocals, Woods and Winds. That about covers the
whole gamut of sounds you would want from any sample-player! Sampletank
2 also introduces STRETCH (Sampletank Time REsynthesis TeCHnology) which
gives complete sonic control over the tempo, pitch and harmonics of
samples for excellent sample pitch transposing and loop synchronization
to your host program's tempo.Although not as in-depth or complex as a GigaStudio,
Sampletank does offer the software-based musician everything he/she
would want in a do-it-all instrument. Each instance of the plug-in
offers 16 parts. You can assign any sound in its library to each part to
create richly layered sounds, an entire band ensemble or even an
entire orchestra! Each of these parts can be assigned to any MIDI
channel (1 to 16) so you can have independent control over each sound or
control multiple parts at the same time. Each part also features
independent solo and mute buttons, panning, volume and output
assignments (up to 16 audio outputs available). This allows for
extremely flexible creation of ensembles, multi-patches, layered sounds
and performance oriented patches that can be stored and recalled at the
click of a button (and a little bit of a wait as the samples are loaded
into memory).click image to enlargeEach of the sound categories features an extensive amount of samples
covering pretty much any style of music and you would be hard pressed
not to find what you are looking for as long as it's not too far out
there (see Sonik Synth for that). Each sound you assign to a part has
its own editable set of straight forward synth parameters like filters,
envelopes, LFOs, etc. and these are all easily tweakable
right from the front panel of the plug-in or via MIDI controllers. In
fact, each sound/part has two envelope sections, a multi-mode filter, two
LFOs, a synth section for tuning & pitch-bend amounts, and velocity controls.
All these tweakable knobs appear in one convenient location and switch
depending on which part is currently hi-lighted or selected. There's even
a multi-effects processor that can assign up to five different effects 
to each part! There's enough easy access controls to really modulate and
manipulate each sound you assign to a part to make it your own.Some extra cool features in the interface include a color adjustment (if
red is too, red; we went for the orange look pictured above), luminosity
adjustment for those darkened studios or on stage, and saturation
controls. Customize its color scheme to suit your needs! Also, keyboard
mapping, layering and zones, portamento (mono, legato & poly modes), global pan, level and chord
memory features round out this excellent and low-cost but high quality
sample-player.As a plug-in, Sampletank kicks some serious butt! It's easy to use,
fully MIDI controllable, visually pleasing and totally intuitive. So the
only major point of debate with such an instrument is the quality of its
sounds. Well a majority of the samples are great and totally useable!
Samples can also be imported from Akai, SampleCell, WAV, AIFF and other formats
too. If you have trouble trudging through the vast amount of sampled
sounds already available, a nifty little search field can help narrow
your search. The only limitations of this plug-in is that it is CPU
intensive and complex ensemble patches can bog down your system if it's
not up to snuff. Therein lies the rub, but it's a livable limitation
for the price and quality of sounds you can get out of this package.

synths. Out of the box Sonik Synth 2 is ready to get you going with over
eight GigaBytes of sampled sounds, multi-effects, and easy access to
simple and effective synthesizer-style controls courtesy of its simple and
intuitive interface. Sonik Synth 2 operates under Macintosh and Windows
platforms as VST, RTAS, DXi and Audio Units plug-ins (unfortunately no
stand-alone version as of yet).Sonik Synth 2 is the type of synth that lets you combine individual
sampled sounds including vintage synths galore, brass, pianos, drums, guitars,
strings, and other sounds to create realistic and/or super-natural
results called Combi Patches. Each Patch can layer up to sixteen
different sounds! You are limited to the library of sounds it ships with
and can not load your own samples however. Nevertheless it ships with
over 5,000 sounds and hundreds of Preset Patches which are plenty enough
to get you started right away, and it is dead-simple to create your own
Combi Patches. The SS2 Instruments are all labeled and categorized
(Synths, Keyboards, Guitars & Bass, Drums, Brass, Winds, Orchestral,
Vocals, SFX and more). Just click on a Part and click on an Instrument
to assign it to that Part. Each Part has its own solo/mute, volume, pan
and output assignments (Sonik Synth supports up to 16 separate outputs
per instance). Polyphony is adjustable from 1 to 256 voices and can be
set individually for each Part - this is great because you can combine a
monophonic drum loop with polyphonic pads so you can play chords without
messing up the loop. You can also assign any MIDI channel to any part
for a truly multitimbral sound module - create one mega performance Combi Patch
or a band-in-a-box-type patch with different instruments on independent MIDI channels and outputs.Up to five separate effects can be assigned to each Part - that's like
having 80 multi-effects onboard! There are 32 types of effects to choose from
including EQ, compression, reverbs, wah-wahs, delays, distortions,
filters, modulations, amplifiers, lo-fi effects and more. An amazing
range of character, warmth, animation and design can be programmed into
each Part creating totally unique and never boring Combi Patches. A
simple click on the name of the effect selected brings up the controls
to tweak the effect to your liking. This effects section couldn't be easier
to use despite its vast potential for sonic design!The same can be said of SS2's synthesizer edit section. It offers eight
pages including LFO 1 & 2, Envelope 1 & 2, Filter, Synth,
Velocity and Macro. Just click on a page such as Filter and the
knobs and switches for the Filter appear. Like the effects section, only
the selected Part in your Combi Patch will be effected by any tweaks you
make here for total sound shaping and modulation control. And even
though the parameters are simple and easy to control they offer a lot of
depth. The LFOs feature multiple waveform shapes, speed, depth, delay,
level and more (but they don't sync to tempo as of yet!!). The envelopes
offer AHDSR controls and more. The filter offers selectable low, band or
hi-pass filtering with 6, 12 or 24 dB/oct slopes and frequency cutoff and
resonance controls. The Synth section offers pitch controls like tuning
and pitch bend amount per Part as well as resampling, pitch/time
shifting and stretching.So how is Sonik Synth 2 different from IK Multimedia's other major plug-in SampleTank? Well they are
based on the same engine and other than one being red and the other blue
they are both ROM-based sample players. The main difference is in their
libraries - SampleTank focuses on natural and acoustic sounds as its
building blocks whereas Sonik Synth 2 offers up a monstrous load of
sampled synthesizers. You'll find classic vintage synths from Arp, Moog,
Mellotron, Serge and Jupiters; as well as FM, granular, wavetable &
additive sounds and some traditional and acoustic sounds which combine
to create some definitely more synth-like and textural sounds that can
only be designed with a plug-in called Sonik Synth! A stand-alone
version would be nice since plug-in operation can lead to either
trouble-free or serious computer crashing depending on your host program
and computer system.Despite it's vast library of sounds and editability, SS2's user interface
is very simple and intuitive. The built-in search
function and the ability to create, edit and rename Parts and Categories
is welcome for helping you find and sort things out. Saving your own
edited or newly created Combi Patches is virtually unlimited. And every
parameter can be controlled via MIDI for mouse-less editing.
Of course the obligatory flip the screen to show the back of the synth
with it's virtual spinning fan is on-board as well.This is a Plug-In that has to be demoed - with so many sounds to choose
from and so many (virtually unlimited) possibilities of combinations
there will be Patches you may love and some that could suck. But no other
plug-in can offer this much sound design control or as many awesome
out-of-the-box Patches to get anyone interested in dance, techno,
hip-hop, pop, folk, ambient, trance, film scoring, sound effects &
design, etc. etc. etc....and in such a simple to use package.",

The Monophonic Synth section has 12 preset sounds (Tuba, Trombone, Trumpet, Sax, Clarinet, Oboe, Flute, Piccolo, Violin, Accordion, El Bass, El Guitar) and one Free patch which lets you use the controls to create your own sound. Basic controls for the filter, the one ADSR for the filter and/or the VCA, and the LFO are laid out plain and simple. The Polyphonic Preset Synth section has Volume & Brightness controls for its four preset Piano type sounds (Piano, Electric Piano, Honkey Tonk, Brass).The String section offers a fairly decent string sound with Volume, Brightness, Attack and Sustain controls for a choice of two preset strings (8"" footage or 4"" footage).The Soundmaker is a bulky synth, weighing in at 27kg! Its keyboard may be split (at middle F only) and the Strings and Poly Synth sections play with the left hand and the Mono Synth plays with the right hand. The keyboard also has polyphonic aftertouch which can be used to control the Mono Synth Brilliance, OSC (vibrato), Synth Glide or Brass Brilliance. The String and Poly Synth sections can be switched to monophonic at the same time. The Farfisa is not the best String Machine you'll ever hear, but it is very rare and that alone gives these machines some serious vintage appeal.",

was released and Logan Electronics began to see some commercial success
from the sales of this instrument. As a result, almost all String

volume control pedal input. But that is it—no CV or Gate options

of like an ensemble effect Preset, recalling its own mix-levels and
attack/decay settings in which all the tone sliders are at full volume.
This is where the ‘mark II’ version differs from the original—it
added four new ensemble effect Presets: ‘O’, ‘ACC.’, ‘SOLO’, and
‘ORGAN’. You must have at least one of these effect Presets on at all

button disengages whatever button was previously engaged, so at least
one button is always engaged. The ‘O’ setting is a subtle chorus effect.
The ‘ACC’ (Accordion) is the closest thing to no ensemble effect,
leaving the strings sounding their driest. ‘SOLO’ is a vibrato-like
effect with some chorusing. ‘ORGAN’ is a really nice chorus that’s
almost phaser-like.The String Melody is a pure string synth, and has a really great

It has a
single analog DCO with three waveforms: sawtooth, square, and PWM (Pulse
Width Modulation). There is an analog filter (12dB/octave) with cutoff,
resonance, and LFO modulation. There is also a simple ADSR envelope for
shaping your sounds. In addition there are also white/pink noise
generators a glide effect and a vibrato effect. It's known for fairly
stable tuning too. Probably its best sounds are the lead ones, the
basses aren't that deep but it sure can scream!What it doesn't have is MIDI, CV/Gate or any other form of control. MIDI
retrofits can take care of this however. Unfortunately there is no patch
memory, and there is no way around this limitation. Its knobs are boldly
colored and well layed-out for easy hands-on access; but you'll need a
Polaroid camera if you want to store your patch settings! Also lacking
are an arpeggiator, sequencer, pitch/mod wheels, and effects.

analog synth that has some unique sounds and characteristics worth
checking out if you find one. It's been used by Future Sound of

presets which include: synthy, harpsichord, flute, clarinet, violin,
trumpet and piano. Presets are selected via the red switches towards the
left of the keyboard.Luckily it has plenty of simple to tweak analog synth functions to
manipulate those boring old preset sounds. It features a single VCO,
switchable over four octaves and equipped with four waveforms (sawtooth,
square, and two rectangular). The VCF is a simple low-pass filter with
cut-off and resonance (emphasis) and can be modulated by the LFO or one
of 3 preset envelope effects. The VCA can also be modulated by these 3
preset envelope effects which include: repeat (which constantly repeats
AD envelope), ASR (with sustain), AD (without sustain). The LFO can
modulate the oscillator or the filter with either square or triangle
waveforms. Finally a Portamento effect is on-board for those elastic
synth sounds. Nice wood end-cheeks and unique Italian sound make this
rarity worth a look, if you happen to find one.",

quality that can compete at the same level as hardware synths! Created

quality, warmth and clarity. The Sylenth1 comes with two layers of
editing, each with dedicated filter, envelopes, LFO's, oscillators, as
well as a global effects bank with an arpeggiator and step-sequencer.Sylenth1 has four band-limited oscillators, with each one having up to
eight stereo voices that can be panned, detuned and phased. Overall, the
Sylenth1 has 16 notes of polyphony, but the polyphonic oscillators means
you can achieve 4 x 8 x 16 = 512 simultaneous voices!Sylenth1 has two highly acclaimed analog style filters, each of which
has four filter types as well as analog overdrive to generate warmth and
bite. These include 12 or 24 dB/oct lowpass modes, bandpass and
highpass. They can also be driven into self-oscillation.There are two LFO's that can be routed to almost all of the parameters,
as well as the two ADSR envelopes, creating a jungle of sound
possibilities.  Keyboard velocity, tracking and mod-wheel data can also
be used to modulate most parameters. The LFO's can be synced to the host
program's tempo.The Master FX section includes 7 high quality effects: Chorus/Flanger,
Phaser (6-stage), Delay (with low and high pass filters and tempo sync),
EQ, Distortion (5 types), Compressor and Reverb — all with
multiple modes and parameters. The Arpeggiator features 10 different
melodic modes and has a built-in step sequencer with adjustable pitch,
velocity and hold settings.Sylenth1 runs exceptionally well on a Mac or PC system. CPU usage is
highly optimized so its RAM and processor requirements are well within
the reach of even the most budget restricted musicians (almost any Intel
with 128 MB). Overall, this is probably one of the best-sounding VST's
out there if you're trying to get an analog sound from a synthesizer

synthesizer heritage. The only competition in its time came from the
Australian made Fairlight CMI. The
Synclavier was a wildly expensive vintage digital sampling synthesizer
reserved for the most successful musicians, commercial studios, and
sound designers. Designed during the '70's, they can still be found
and prized by various sound designers, composers, and musicians.
Although there have been three models, (the second called the Synclavier
II pictured above) they are most often referred to as just a
Synclavier.The first version appeared in 1977/78 but was soon replaced by the
Synclavier II in 1980 with a new ""partial timbre"" sound editing feature (it
tweaks the harmonics), built-in FM and additive synthesis, sampling, 64
voice polyphony, 32MB of waveform RAM (expandable to 768), 32 outputs,
music-notation printing, multitrack sequencing, and digital hard-disk
recording. In 1984 a third model was introduced and became the most
infamous version of the line-up. The new features included a full sized
and weighted keyboard with velocity and aftertouch which replaced the
previous model's plastic keyboard, and 128 voices polyphony. An
optional DSP effects package including time compression/expansion was
available for the Synclav as well. There was also a standard onboard
arpeggiator and a robust sequencer with up to 200 tracks and its sampler
had the ability to record and output at up to 100 khz!The typical Synclavier system consists of a durable 76-note keyboard
peppered with 132 illuminated buttons and a single control knob,
connected to a rack-mounted CPU running NED's own 16-bit ABLE operating
system plus the nostalgic mid-eighties looking mono-chromatic computer
monitor/keyboard. Patches, sound files, sequences and samples are stored
to 5.25"" diskette, hard disk or in some models, magneto-optical
drives.It should be noted that there are all sorts of 'sub-revisions' of
the hardware component of the Synclav II, and these make each version
capable/incapable of doing certain things. Some lower-end versions are
not capable of using the 'Timbre-frame' timbral scanning programming
method. Others are not capable of handling a MIDI retrofit. And all of
these have different 'top versions' of the OS that they can handle,
making the purchase of a used Synclav system a dicey affair. You can't
always be 100% sure of which variation you're buying without some
extreme care being paid to which hardware it has and what versions of
the OS it's capable of running. You could therefore be buying anything
from a high-end sampling/sequencing workstation unit to a rather complex
12-op FM/additive synth, and several possibilities in between.From its specs alone it can be seen that the Synclavier is a
masterpiece digital sampler / synthesizer workstation which was the
first of its kind, and way ahead of its time. They command prices well
into the thousands ($25,000 to $200,000) and are only used by those who
can afford such. New Synclavier systems (including new hardware,
software, and Mac OS X emulations of the Synclavier operating system)
service, and support are currently available through DEMAS, the
company created after the fall of New England Digital in 1992.
Additional service and support can also be found at Synhouse and Synclavier European
Services.Synclaviers have been used by The Cure, New Order, George Duke,
Pat Metheny, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Foreigner, Michael Jackson,
Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, Genesis, Kim Wilde, The Cars, Soft Cell,
Geoff Downes, Frank Zappa, and film composer Alan Silvestri.",

1985. Of the approximately 700 to 800 that were produced, it is
estimated that less than 100 may still be in operation today. In the
1970's, Bell Laboratories developed a high-speed additive oscillator
system which was used by Digital Keyboards, a US-based division of the
Italian synth/organ maker Crumar, to create a sophisticated additive
synthesizer known as the Crumar General Development System (GDS). The
GDS originally sold for about $27,500. The Synergy was essentially a
lower-cost version of the GDS, without all the programmability of the
GDS, and a price tag closer to $5,300. After a few years of production,
DKI and the Synergy were shut down. However, the technology in the
Synergy was ported over to a new instrument known as the Mulogix Slave
32, a rack-mount MIDI-equipped version of the Synergy, and was produced
until 1989.Although the Synergy is not programmable, it does feature 24 tone
presets (with many more available via 24-tone cartridges). The sounds
are generated by additive synthesis and phase modulation using 32
digital oscillators, computer controlled, and allocated dynamically.
Polyphony is variable, depending on the selected tone preset. Typically
the Synergy is eight-voice polyphonic with four oscillators being used
per voice. However, some tones may use only two oscillators per voice,
allowing up to 16-voice polyphony.The Synergy can also play up to four different tone presets
simultaneously, a very unique feature for its time. These tones could be
assigned to the keys of the keyboard in a number of different ways, such
as in unison, rotating (each new note triggers the next tone),
first-available, fixed-split, and a unique floating-split mode in which
a tone tracks the movement of a hand, thereby not limiting the player to
the confines of traditional fixed-split keyboard conventions.The Synergy also features a four-track sequencer. The sequencer can
record in real-time, allows for overdubbing, as well as the ability to
play free on top of your recorded sequence. Up to 1,860 notes can be
recorded. The Synergy has very flexible envelopes as well. The envelopes
have up to 16 stages per oscillator for both amplitude and frequency,
with multiple rates and breakpoints, and they are loop-able.The keyboard is a large 74-note affair with velocity sensitivity. The
keyboard velocity controls both the amplitude and timbre of the tone via
a pair of sensitivity controls that can be used to dial in the amount of
amplitude or timbre you want affected. The timbre control affects the
filter/brightness or the effect of a sound (ie: delay), depending on the
tone preset. A joystick is used, somewhat oddly situated on the left
front panel, to control the programmable pitch-bend and vibrato
modulation. An intelligent portamento effect is on-board as well, that
can produce portamento glides polyphonically, allowing for multiple
sliding notes at the same time.The Synergy has eight user-memory slots for storing the setup of the
keyboard playing state. The depth, rate and amount of vibrato available
to the joystick can be stored, as well as the speed and type of
portamento selected, transposition of the keyboard, velocity sensitivity
settings, and mono/polyphonic modes. Sequencer data, however, is
volatile and will be lost when turned off.Even without the ability to program the sounds of the Synergy, its
responsive keyboard and flexible envelope features make for a very
expressive instrument. The preset tones can reproduce acoustic
instruments such as pianos and strings with great realism and clarity.
But FM-type sounds and other digital synth timbres are also on tap. The
looping envelopes and sequencer can also be used to create eerie
textures, and swirling, morphing drones and pads with plenty of
complexity.It was the Yamaha DX7 that did the Synergy
in, at the end. The DX7 was capable of creating many similar types of
sounds, but was at the same time, totally programmable and cost three
times less. The Synergy has been used by Wendy Carlos
(and used almost exclusively on her albums Digital
Moonscapes and Beauty in the Beast). Carlos
also used the GDS, which was used on the TRON soundtrack. Carlos has
also programmed many sounds for the GDS/Synergy, some of which are
available on preset cartridges.Later models of the Synergy, known as the Synergy II+, feature MIDI
implementation, 24 user voice RAM, and an RS-232 computer port. This
allowed support for Kaypro II portable computer systems running Synergy
voicing software to open up the possibility to finally edit the sounds
of the Synergy as well as to save patch and sequence data on to floppy
disk.The GDS, Synergy, Synergy II+ and Slave 32 are all historic
synthesizers. While not commercially successful like the Yamaha DX7,
they are still among the finest synthesizers ever made due to their
amazing sounds and flexible performance features, and they were
certainly ahead of their time. Wendy Carlos still uses the Synergy to

Besides the presets push buttons, the Syntex features 14 sliders, 12 rotary pots, 8 push buttons and 2 knob switches. Actually the electronics design engineer did not want to know about presets... he would have preferred more features and no presets. In 1975 the Welson Syntex was already digitally controlled, so it stays perfectly in tune.The actual presets are 15. There is no wheels or joystick for modulation or pitch, no retrigger options and no CV/gate. You could mount it on the optional legs it used to come with or on top of an organ.This synth has two peculiarities to ensure that the player reaches the keys more easily when he or she is seated and the instruments are on top of one another:1. The carved bottom matches with top instruments with a width of no more than 96cm (it is heavier in the rear, so it doesn’t roll out if inserted that way)2. The keyboard is inclined by 6°.It has 2 VCO. A third oscillator is used only as LFO. The greatest limit of the Syntex is that its VCOs have just one waveform and that is the same for both OSC1 and OSC2. The controls are very good and this really would have been powerful synth if they had added more waveforms.With all the footage faders at max and the VCF all open, the Syntex resembles the Davolisint, but the Davoli tone is more distinctive. With a few footage sliders at max, acting on the filter, the sound resemble a Moog Synth (again, with the great limit of only one waveform!).The synth has 37 keys from C to C. The control panel is divided into two main parts. Both parts are conveniently divided into sections. The part at the left of the keyboard includes four sections: OSC1, OSC2, ADSR and VCF. The oscillators are very stable with very little drifting.OSC 1 controls include 32’, 16’, 8’, 4’ footages with individual sliders, and general Pitch control, but you can adjust it only in a 2 tones range.OSC 2 footages are 16’, 8’, 4’, 2’ and a Tune pot changes OSC2 pitch from down a fourth to up a fifth in respect to OSC1. The Syntex has a frequency range that can go from 30 to more than 5.000 Hz, not bad!Both OSC1 and OSC2 have a Vibrato amount pot (speed e-type is controlled via OSC3). ENVELOPE generator is the classic ADSR: attack, decay, sustain, release (four sliders with a useful graphic explication).The VCF is a discrete transistor ladder filter. There is a pot for OSC3 amount and one for ADSR amount, and two sliders: one for frequency cutoff labeled Fr, and the other for resonance labeled Q.Under the keyboard from left to right are five sections: OSC3, NOISE, PRESETS, GLIDE, VCA. OSC3 (modulator). The OSC3 has square and sawtooth waveforms and is self-resonant. One pot is for the oscillator frequency (from 1 to 50 Hz), and a knob switch for selecting the waveform.Four colored push buttons are for connecting OSC3 to the OSC1, OSC2, VCF, VCA sections and the Random Music. In each section a red LED lights up, showing OSC3 frequency when the relative push-button is engaged.NOISE. A knob switch for selecting White or Pink noise. One pot is for the volume.
PRESETS. Pushing the red button you get to the presets. The overall quality of the presets lies in between the ARP Pro Soloist and TEISCO S100P.
White buttons: Flute, Trombone, Horn, Oboe, Bass clarinet.
Blue buttons: Jaw harp, Wha wha, Accordion, Strings.
Yellow buttons: Xylophone, Bass Guitar, Spinet. Green buttons: Space, Buzz, Musical saw.
Most of the presets use only OSC1. With the String preset, tuning OSC2 a fifth above or a fourth down, one gets a very beautiful timbre.
Accordion and Space are the other presets that use OSC2. Musical saw mimics a Theremin (Glide is engaged). All can be adjusted via a selected part of controls that varies according to the different presets, so they can be used as raw material for getting interesting variations.
GLIDE. A pot for speed and a button for ON-OFF operating. VCA. OSC3 amount pot and ADSR amount pot. The combination of the two gets very interesting results. The instrument doesn’t play if the VCA ADSR amount is at zero.
VOLUME controls the general loudness of the synth. A button labeled INITIAL VOLUME acts as a sustain switch: if you press it, the instrument keeps on sounding the last played note until you switch it off.
Above the keyboard are 2 push buttons. At the far left the ON-OFF switch. Almost in the middle, there is a Random Music button, pushing it a sort of sample and hold start to play. It can be controlled by all the commands but not from the keys, so is not so convenient. The Welson Syntex engine was also integrated with a very rare three manual spinet organ: the Welson Privilege 400.",

from the Italian company FBT Electronica S.P.A. (founded by Bruno
Baldoni and Vincio Tanoni in 1963, and mainly dedicated to the
production of amplifiers and mix consoles) to introduce itself into the
emergent market of synths. Later on, and also without much success, the
same company would introduce the Synther-4000.The Synther-2000 is a monophonic synth equipped with three VCOs (each
with square and saw-tooth waveform generation) and based on the
substractive synthesis method. It has also two simple filter & envelope
sections. The filtering section is composed of a single filter with
cutoff, a level control for each oscillator, and keyboard control,
whilst the envelope control allows three different setups: AD
(Attack/Decay), A (single Attack) and an interesting continuous attack
(a rudimentary arpeggiator). It is also equipped with a noise generator
for oscillators 2 and 3.The Synther-2000 keyboard has 37 keys, but does not have pitch bend and
modulation wheels. Instead, it has a slider for the continuous control
of oscillator-1 frequency. In this respect, it does remind one of a
Theremin sound. The Synther-2000 also possesses a sweep control that is
very similar to the classic portamento effect.Due to the small number of units made and their limited distribution
area, at present it is really difficult to find one of these small
pieces of vintage synth.",

It's a monophonic lead synth in the same category as the Minimoog, Arp Odyssey, and Roland SH-7. But the Syrinx is pretty rare, only a few hundred were produced from 1983 through 1984.   The Syrinx uses seven Curtis chips for its VCO's, VCF's and envelopes. It has two analog VCO's, a sub-oscillator and three flexible voltage-controlled filters. You can switch between the three filters for either a 24 dB lowpass, or two bandpass filters, and they can be patched in four different ways (series/parallel). Additionally the Syrinx has two LFO's, FM, PWM, osc-sync, 2 ADSR envelopes, ring modulation, portamento and a cool touch-pad that can control various parameters from pitch-bending to the LFO rate. The Syrinx's Mixer section lets you adjust levels for each VCO and the sub-osc as well as the Noise Generator and Ring Modulator. Unfortunately, being released around 1983, the Syrinx just missed out on MIDI and patch memory options. They came in a variety of flavors over the years. Most were black, but a handful were blue, red, or white. Some later models had no keyboard and were mounted in a flight-case, and a mid-nineties re-issue was a very rare rack-mount version with MIDI and external audio in. The Syrinx has been used by Aphex Twin, Xpando, Air, Vince Clarke, Depeche Mode, and Electronic Dream Plant. ",

waveforms like the 303, and adds a ring modulator and external audio
input. There's no Accent but this synth has MIDI with velocity
sensitivity (there's your accent). Although it has a sequencer, it is
very simple and hidden. Therefore, there is no cool 303 slide effect.
However, slide effects can be controlled through MIDI, as well as every
other editable parameter using MIDI SysEx commands!As a 303 emulator it sounds pretty darn good. However, it costs almost
as much as the real deal. The Syntecno TeeBee has MIDI in/out, Roland
Din Sync and CV / Gate in/out as well as an external audio input making
a creative tool in your studio for emulating 303's, filtering external
audio such as drum loops or voice, and controlling older synths using CV

monophonic/duophonic analog synthesizer with 2 oscillators capable of
square and sawtooth waveforms. VCO 1 also has a triangle waveform. Each
of the waveforms can be played simultaneously and mixed together and
there are additional sub-octave oscillators on each oscillator to blend
new and interesting sounds.The original Cats were purely
monophonic, but then came the SRM update which added the duophonic
(2-voice) capability. The Cat (SRM) has a 2-note sample-and-hold feature
for each voice too! The Keyboard can be switched between 2-voice (poly)
and 1-voice (mono) modes. In mono mode the 2 oscillators can be stacked
for a rich mono-bass or mono-lead synth sound. Poly mode limits the
richness of the sound because each VCO becomes a separate dedicated
voice. In this mode you can create slightly more complex melodies with
overlapping notes or very basic pads. The sub-osc plays at an octave
below the actual note played which nicely adds some warmth or bottom to
your sounds. It has been used by The Dust Brothers, Chemical
Brothers, Devo, Rod Argent, David Bedford, Lyn Berger, Dave Greenslade,

They have recreated the classic Arp 2600 with their software plug-in, the TimewARP 2600. Rather than adapting a general purpose synth-modeling algorithm to suite the needs of reproducing ARP-like sounds, WOW designed this software from the ground up to specifically recreate every nuance of the original 2600's look and sound. And they succeeded! The TimewARP 2600 is supported and endorsed by the 2600's designer and ARP founder himself, Alan R. Pearlman. Of course there are some updates to the 2600 that adapt it to life in the computer age as well (total MIDI control & automation should go without saying). TimewARP 2600 is (as of this writing) an RTAS plug-in and will only work in Pro-Tools 6.1 or later. But VST, Audio Unit, TDM, and stand-alone versions will surely follow soon. While the original 2600 is monophonic, the TimewARP can support up to eight voices of polyphony, but this can be quite a CPU gobbler and is really dependent on the power of your computer. The plug-in's interface is a very realistic recreation of the original ""grey-meanie"", with only a few tweaks or modifications. Patching and creating your own sounds is done just like on a real 2600. And finally you can store and categorize your 2600 creations using the TimewARP's unlimited patch memory manager.But this is where the TimewARP can let some users down. It ships with a rather boring and small set of presets. In other words, if you were hoping to browse through oodles of patches to find the perfect bass, lead, or pad, you will likely be disappointed. That said, however, if you are one to experiment, you can really get into creating some amazing sounds if you know how or are willing to learn. The TimewARP 2600 is definitely aimed at those of us who maybe once owned a 2600 and are looking for an inexpensive and practical way of getting one back, or anybody who wants to learn and experiment with analog synthesis the old-school way!TimewARP 2600 comes closer to sounding like the real thing than any other software synth emulator out there! The three VCO's sound great, the filter is excellent with realistic self-oscillating resonance and almost no glitchy stair-stepping during slow gradual filter sweeps. The envelopes, LFO, keyboard controls, and CV/Gate options give the keen programmer lots of options for creating some really wild sounds just like on the original 2600. Even the original's built-in spring reverb and a virtual ARP 3620 keyboard are reproduced here. Perhaps the TimewARP 2600 is a little too good at reproducing the original - the plug-in seems to generate a little bit of noise at it's outputs while idle just like most real analog gear would do.If you've got yourself a Pro-Tools rig and the chops to program such a beast as the ARP 2600, WOW's TimewARP 2600 is a steal! At $250, no aging 30 year-old 2600 can come close to offering what this little plug-in can! And WOW's plans to add support for more platforms and to create an on-line user patch library should make the TimewARP un-beatable in the future!",

by Tim Orr, also notable for his work at EMS and Akai. In the late
1970s, a good synthesizer was too expensive for many musicians, so Orr
conceived the Transcendent 2000 as an affordable kit that could be
assembled at home - a similar concept to the one used by PAiA in the
United States. According to legend, EMS didn't want their name
associated with the varying build quality of a home made synth, hence
the kit being marketed by Powertran.In order to keep the kit cheap to manufacture and easy to assemble,
it came in the form of a single PCB that was carefully laid out and
accompanied by detailed schematics. Despite this simplicity, the build
quality of an individual Transcendent obviously reflects the skill of
the assembler. Common problems include a wobbly case, sticky keys, and
potentiometers mounted too close to the front panel, making them awkward
to adjust. As long as the synth hasn't been bodged too badly, these are
all simply remedied by a competent owner.Even though it was a single oscillator monophonic aimed at the
musician on a budget, Orr didn't skimp on the Transcendent's features.
The control section sports portamento and a pitch bender (although the
original potentiometer lacks a center detent). The oscillator can be
switched between a saw or pulse waveform, with an adjustable gradient
for the saw, and width for the pulse which can also be modulated by the
LFO. Pitch can be modulated by the LFO, or by a sample and hold with the
rate controlled by the LFO. There is also a noise generator for more
percussive sounds (it also acts as the source of randomness for the
sample and hold). The oscillator amplitude can be shaped by a typical
ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope generator.The filter features the usual frequency and resonance controls, with
adjustable levels of modulation from both the LFO and a simple AD
(Attach, Decay) envelope. Unusually for a low budget synth, the filter
can be switched between lowpass and bandpass modes. The filter can
produce extremely vicious resonant squeals, and there are even reports
from users who have blown up a badly calibrated Transcendent with too
high a resonance setting!Sockets on the back of the synth provide inputs for CV and gate
signals, a foot pedal to control filter frequency, and for an external
audio source to be fed into the filter. The CV and gate inputs can be a
little bit problematic, as the Transcendent doesn't conform to the
usual 1V/Octave ratio, and the external gate will only trigger if a key
is already held down on the keyboard. These problems can be easily
rectified by using a MIDI converter that allows tuning of the CV ratio
and by carrying out a simple modification that adds a switch to disable
the keyboard when using external control.Overall, the Transcendent 2000 is a great little monophonic synth,
with a character similar to that of the Korg
MS-20, but selling for a fraction of the price. The simplicity of
the design also allows for some interesting modifications. In terms of
famous users, this was the first synth owned by Joy Division, and
can be heard on their debut album ""Unknown Pleasures"". Pictures from the
Joy Division recording sessions also show legendary producer Martin
Hannett using the Transcendent along with an ARP
Omni II.",

The selling price for a complete kit in 1982 was £295; at the same time the Transcendent 2000 (mono synth) was sold as a complete kit for £165. The Powertran CEM based Polysynth complete kit (with 1 voice) was sold for £275 with up to 3 additional plug in voice kits at £42 each and £245 for the 4 voice expansion kit taking the Polysynth to 8 voices (16 CEMM based Oscillators). All three Powertran synths were designed by Tim Orr (EMS).The Transcendent DPX was designed to be a versatile keyboard instrument with a choice of several different voices and characteristic waveform envelopes with a split keyboard and a dynamic option. Realistically, the functions of the DPX are fairly basic in comparison with other Digital Piano and String synthesizers of the time though the inside design and build was ahead of most due to the minimalist cabling required. DPX has two types of “Piano” sound (Honky and Piano) plus Strings and Brass sounds selected using multi poled switches that interlock with one another on the front panel. There is a chorus, vibrato and delay function along with tone and volume control. The keyboard is touch sensitive, the keyboard DAC is 6bit – but 61 note not 64. Output of the DPX is mono (high, low).The DPX sound generation is based on a single master oscillator (the NE566) producing a 1000.45KHz square wave which is then digitally divided by twelve integers and then divide down further from the top octave, this gives the DPX full polyphony. The cost, restricted functionality and multiple circuit board build of the DPX meant the number of kit units sold was far less than that of the still popular “single board” Transcendent 2000 Mono Synth kit. Powertran’s other synth Kit, the Transcendent Polysynth, was also seen as far too complex for most people to build so again these also did not sell in great numbers.It is hard to estimate how many surviving DPX remain in working order as a large number of the kits sold never got off the ground due to failed construction. Even if they didn’t fail to begin with it, was only a matter of time before they did - mainly due to the inexperience in electronic construction by the person who purchased them and as such lead to poor build quality. It is safe to assume that during the late 1980's and throughout 1990’s during digital instrument revolution, a large number of self-built kits from Powertran and other suppliers found their way to landfill. Most of the surviving DPX units that now become available have severe faults and normally need a rebuild from the ground up. All considered, the Transcendent DPX looks good with wooden ends and matt black painted panels. It’s fairly large but not heavy and sounds good if used in conjunction with outboard FX.",

can give your sounds a unique and ""aggressive"" edge! All input/output jacks and control knobs are located right on the front of the 2-space rack-mount unit. 
A small view-window is at the center of the unit through which you can see the tubes glowing.
Distortion can be introduced during the preamp stage. The PWM and Beam controls can then be used 
to fold, distort and mangle up your sounds with unpredictable but surprising results.
The built-in LFO creates a pseudo-panning effect with adjustable rate and 
stereo beam width using the L1, L2 and SPEED controls. For a gritty new take
on analog distortion the TS-21 is an expensive but tempting offer.",

four-octave range. Capable of complex filtering, the TS-22 lets you sweep the lows, 
mids, highs, etc. independent of one another or you can latch them all in unison.
Tweaking can be accomplished from the knobs on the unit or via external CV sources
from other analog equipment. A round window at the center of the unit provides a
view of the glowing tubes at work inside!The TS-22's unique use of vacuum-tubes gives it a unique sound that is analog, clean
and sometimes unpredictable. Also included is a vacuum-tube pentode voltage-controlled 
amplifier (VCA) to shape the effect of the filter on your sounds. Adjustable resonance
that leads to self-oscillation for each filter is also a treat! CV inputs to control the filter
sweeps and VCA allow easy integration with your existing analog synths!

currently on the market. For just $300 you get a truly modular synth with fat 
sounds, wonderful filters and plenty of sonic possibilities. Oh, and as for its analog sounds, 
they sound excellent! Connect the outputs of any module to the inputs of any other module. 
Patching is done via a matrix modulation system. Unlike many similar
Modular Software synths VAZ does not 'emulate' the use of visual patch cords when
connecting various modules in your synth patch. Simple, computer-friendly Menus
are used instead to route signals between modules. This makes it quicker to use
and is far better for modular newbies. VAZ Modular 2 gives you the hardware equivalent of up to 16 modular synths,
sampler(s), sequencer(s), 16 Channel Mixer, various effects and support for the
ever expanding range of DirectX and VST Plug-ins, either as a module within a
synth and/or at the mixing stage.
It has got 66 modules (but you can link up to 255 of them in any combination per synth). There are sound sources
such as modeled analog multi-oscillators, granular synthesis, wavetable synthesis, a noise gen, 
live input and more. Audio is processed by various types of rich sounding filters
(multi-mode, comb, etc.) with distortion, ring modulation and other goodies.
Effects include reverb, delay, chorus, flange and more. Modulation
effects are provided by the various LFO modules, envelope followers and other
envelope effects. Truly wacky sounds are possible.There's also a sampler allowing mapping of instrument and drum samples across keyboard range(s).
It can be used to fill up the wavetables with custom sounds for use in synth patches.
And it can be used to 'process' digital audio files through any of its modules.
Selectable audio output rates of 11, 22, 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz for individual patches.There  are three multi-row 16-step pattern-based sequencers with step- and real-time recording and editing.
The CV/Gate Sequencer is analog style (like an ARP Sequencer) using 16 rows of sliders to 
adjust note pitches and controller info in the Sequencer Window. The Trigger Sequencer
resembles 808-style drum machine programming. The Control Sequencer is like the CV/Gate
but with four control outputs for use as controller automation. All three sequencers
can run simultaneously and in MIDI sync. There's also a useful arpeggiator 
(up, down, up/down, random, 1-4octave).
MIDI to CV conversion is also built-in. There's MIDI control of on screen sliders and switches from
any MIDI source or QWERTY keyboard. Presets include emulations of many a classic synths and many
new sounds.",

It
quickly became a very popular and favorite synth with its aggressive
analog sounds. It's got knobs, analog synth sounds and drums and a whole
lot more! The Virus uses physical-modeling to digitally re-create analog
sounds. German precision got it right! The Virus has an incredibly
punchy and clean analog sound that can give you anything from low
sub-woofer blowing basses to overdriven 303-style lead lines! The module
is layed out with a very intuitive design that even old-school
synthesists will feel right at home with. It has 32 knobs and 27
buttons, all of which allow tweaking in realtime. With 12 note polyphony
and 16 multitimbral parts, the Virus is all you need to create complete
and vibrant electronic music tracks!With basic analog waveforms, from sawtooth to pulse with PWM, dual
oscillators and filters, two LFO's with sample-and-hold and on-board
arpeggiators, you'll find yourself in vintage synth heaven. The Virus
can make convincing TB-303, SH-101 and other great bass/lead
sounds, as well as a host of analog drum and percussion sounds. You'll
also find an advanced ADSTR envelope, effects like chorus, flange,
delays, and a very nice Vocoder! Every parameter is MIDI controllable
making this a great tool for use in the studio.In 1999, Access released a next generation model which they called the
Virus B (making the original sometimes
referred to as the Virus A). Following that came the KB (keyboard version), Indigo (Roadster version) and Rack (rack-mountable sound-module
version). In 2002, an even more advanced C series was released including
the Virus C, KC, Indigo 2, and Rack XL. A slightly 'hot-rodded'
form of the original Virus A was also released in 2000 as the Digidesign
Virus TDM plug-in for Pro Tools users,
followed in 2002 by an Indigo TDM
version. Viruses have been used by Astral Projection, BT, 
Überzone, The Crystal Method, Cosmosis, and Nine Inch Nails.Click here for a PDF

The original Virus A had 12-voice polyphony, but the new OS in the Virus B doubles the polyphony from 12- to 24-voices and the oscillators, from 2 to 3 per voice. The new OS also added an enhanced programmable 32-band vocoder. There are now up to 82 simultaneous effects, a retro-phaser (6-stage stereo phaser with 24 filter-poles), chorus/flanger, ring modulator, multiple forms of distortion, an analog boost algorithm, and an envelope follower. Up to five FM (Frequency Modulation) modes are also on-board now and many new sounds have been created for this bigger and better version of the Virus. OS 4.0 was released in late 2000 with even more amazing features! The update is downloadable from Access (free of charge!) and comes installed in all new Virus synths to ship after its release. OS 4.0 adds a reverb with advanced features such as pre-delay sync-able to Midi clock. There's also a groove delay, surround sound capability, external effect sends using the individual outputs, an Intelligent Random Patch Generator, sound categories to sort all your patches in a logical order, Direct FX to use your Virus as an effects-processor while maintaining full polyphony, 16 independent arpeggiators with numerous patterns and realtime parameter access, and an advanced distortion module with lo-fi and filter dsp-effects. OS 4.0 makes the Virus one of the best analog modeling synthesizers to date! Complete control of parameters is available via MIDI. ""Adaptive Control Smoothing"" ensures ultra smooth parameter changes. There's also a free Emagic sound-driver based Editor/Librarian for Windows and MacOS. Virus KB Pictured above is the Virus KB. It packs all the guts of the Virus B into a full sized keyboard with 61 velocity and aftertouch sensitive keys. There are also individual and assignable Pitch and Mod wheels. Nice emulated wood panels and a layout that remains faithful to the module's intuitive design make the Virus KB model an excellent dance and electronic music synthesizer for professional quality music and groovy results.Virus RackIn 2001, the Virus Rack (pictured above) was released. This module retains most of the features through version 4.0 but sacrifices polyphony and an oscillator. This was to make the Virus significantly more affordable. Polyphony has been reduced to 16-voices but multitimbrality is still 16-parts. Instead of four, there are three oscillators per voice (two main oscillators plus one sub oscillator). Otherwise it has all the same great features as the Virus B! In 2002 the entire B series line of Virus synths were replaced by all new versions: the Virus C, Virus KC and Virus Rack XL.Virus IndigoLate 2000 also saw the release of a sleek, newly styled Virus called the Indigo (pictured above). Dubbed the 'Virtual Analog Roadster', the Indigo is a retro-styled twist on the amazing Virus synthesizer. It blends classic Roland, Moog and ARP style with the great features and sounds of the Virus B (OS 4.0). It adds a stout 37-note keyboard and a cool new grey/blue look. It's compact, easy to play, fun to tweak, and is a powerful synth!

It could easily be written off as a Virus C with added supersaw, but the many improvements suggest revolution, not evolution!The TI includes several oscillator sources from simple sine/tri/saw through to wavetables (63 to choose from, nicely varied; the 64th wavetable is actually the pure sine wave) and also granular and formant sources based on the wavetables. The supersaw mode is present and allows big, spreadable saws with a huge unison effect - you can dial in over 100 oscillators per note if your mix (and your monitors) can take it.If you want it on a digital synth oscillator section, then this has it: 3 oscillators, multiple modes, FM (with several FM applications), oscillator sync, an additional subosc and a noise source. There'll be a bit of menu diving though - the TI may have more physical controls than any Virus before it, but options here outweigh controllers. Fortunately, the menus are logically laid out and fairly simple. The common parameters are on the front panel, and the most in-depth tweaking lies no more than four menu-pages under the hood.There are dual filters with multiple modes from Lowpass, Hipass, Bandpass, Bandreject to more DSP-intensive emulations of analog 1- , 2- and 4-pole modes (the so-called Minimoog emulation). These filters are what really make the synth and impart a definite character to the Virus. Most would agree that the Virus sounds dark and ominous rather than the bright, crisp sounds of the Clavias and Korgs. They whine and screech when you crank up the resonance into the self-oscillating regions as well! Regardless of whether the filter emulations perfectly copy the originals, or any preconceptions regarding what is analog or digital, these filters are a modern classic and can be argued to have already made it onto even more vinyl acreage than the venerable Minimoog. The Virus really IS several genres of dance music; as much a signature sound as the saxophone to modern be-bop. To dismiss it as a dance floor-only synth would be criminal, however.The Mod Matrix and LFO sections are comprehensive - 18 mod matrix slots, 3 LFO's (which can do double duty as simple third envelopes - although a 3rd envelope feature isn't expressly provided) which can do all the usual LFO tricks. The matrix can even modulate itself; perfect for sonic experiments, but it can be a test of memory (yours, not the synth's) remembering just what it is you're trying to modulate. Too many options may not be a valid complaint, but what this synth could really do with is a screen-based editor......And it's the computer integration which the TI does better than any other computer-age synth to date. There's a USB1 (not USB2, but fast enough for most tasks) interface which doubles as both a DSP audio interface for you computer and enables an onscreen librarian VST3/AU/RTAS plugin interface to appear in your software of choice. If you can do it on the synth, you can do it onscreen, except that some parameters (like arpeggiator settings) can only really be edited on the computer. On the subject of the arp, there's no step sequencer option, which is a shame because this synth really can nail those Berlin school drones and sequences.Virus TI software interfaceThe hardware is a metal-skinned, wooden-ended tank, with solid knobs that turn easily yet feel as though they're set in concrete. The desktop version lets you remove the wood, replace with rack ears, and tilt the I/O panel through 90 degrees so you don't lose a rack space above the unit - very clever. The keyed versions have the very best keybed available on a synthesizer today (synth-weight or semi-weight by Fatar); note that aftertouch is only monophonic. Tap-tempo and simple Oct+/- buttons which transpose semitones with a simple click of the 'shift' key; this keyboard makes for a great master controller for both computer-based and hardware-based sequencers. Multi-mode is available for the older-school studios with 16-channel MIDI multitimbrality. This is a synth for the computer age, but multi-mode is genuinely useable due to the synth's awesome dual-DSP polyphony. You'll run out of hardware sequencer notes before the synth does.Virus TI 5-octave keyboard modelRounding the synth is a studio-spec effects section, with delays (including tape delays - clocked and free running with modulation and bandwidth options), a great sounding reverb (which is used in perhaps a little too many of the 4,000 - yes 4,000 - factory presets) and EQ options with Q control. There's a distortion mode which can spit your sound out for breakfast, and phaser/chorus/unison effects for thick washes of sounds. You can play a 4-minute pad that never sounds the same twice on this synth; a great drone machine. Analog EQ emulations were added recently, and subtly tweak your sound in all the good ways.There's also the small matter of the after-sales service from Access, which is second to none; email support, even for secondhand purchasers, and free lifetime updates (sometimes even after the synth has been replaced in the lineup by something newer). Unless you've been on Mir or Mars for 10 years, you've heard of the Virus. The TI model is the best Virus to date. Even if you have an irrational hatred of digital synthesis, you have to admit that this is the top-of-the-digital-tree at the moment.Virus TI2 DesktopIn 2009 the Virus TI2 Desktop, Keyboard and Polar revisions were released, featuring 25% faster DSP processing, a lighter, redesigned enclosure, new effects including Tape Delay, Frequency Shifter, new Distortions, and Character Control, and an enhanced Virus Control 3.0 plug-in.Virus TI2 Keyboard",

Indigo), with a white-out front panel and a mix of aluminum and
wood siding. The LEDs are white as well as the LCD display panel. Simply
put, the Polar puts all the power of the Virus TI into a keyboard meant
to be taken on the road.Under the hood, there are three oscillators with one sub oscillator per
voice which give it the ability to create throbbing and full basses as
well as soft and beautiful pads and screaming leads. Within each of the
main oscillators, there is a wide collection of waveforms including the
classic Virus  virtual analog oscillator models (saw, variable pulse,
sine, triangle, and 62 spectral waves with several FM modes), the
awesome HyperSaw model (a multi sawtooth oscillator with up to 9 stacked
oscillators, along with 9 sub oscillators and a sync oscillator), a
Wavetable oscillator model (with 100 multi-index wavetables), a
Graintable oscillator model (for granular synthesis that can warp
waveforms into new twisted forms), and Formant waveforms.There are two multi-mode filters (HP, LP, BP, BS) as well as a
saturation module for adding distortion or lo-fi effects. There is also
an Analog Filter modeled after the Moog cascade filter with 6 to 24
dB/oct slope options and is capable of self-oscillation and can be
overdriven.The Virus TI Polar includes a wide array of modulation capabilities
including a two dimensional modulation matrix with 6 sources and 3
destinations each (18 routings total). With this you can modulate almost
anything in the Virus in real time. There are also three LFOs that can
also be used as ramp generators and two very fast ADSTR envelope
generators.A complete effects section is also on hand, with 129 parallel effects.
There is independent delay and reverb for each patch, multiple
distortion/lo-fi algorithms, phaser, chorus/flanger, character control,
ring modulator/shifter, 3-band EQ, and a global vocoder. There is also
the popular Virus Atomizer, a unique audio slicer which can turn your
Virus into a powerful realtime FX unit perfect for DJ applications.The Virus TI Polar's ""Total Integration"" comes from its
sophisticated OS and USB port which connect it straight into the
following certified hosts: Apple Logic, Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live,
Avid Pro Tools, Cakewalk Sonar and ImageLine FL Studio. The VIRUSControl
plug-in automatically detects and connects the Polar to your host
program, where it will appear as a VST/AU soft-synth. The Polar can even
be turned into a dedicated remote MIDI controller, mapping each of its
33 knobs to a MIDI CC messages.Access Virus TI2 PolarIn 2009 an upgraded second edition model, the TI2 Polar, was released
with 25% faster DSP processing, increased polyphony (from 80 on the TI
up to 110 voices on the TI2), more effects and a redesigned housing. And
if white isn't your thing, there is a limited edition Dark Star model,
which has a pure black paint job along with a trick red glowing/pulsing

of the best hardware DSP powered virtual analog synths in the market,
and scaling it down to a small desktop module and slashing its price tag
by $1,000. That is exactly what the Virus TI Snow does. German synth
makers Access have taken their flagship Virus TI, drastically reduced
the front panel controls, reduced DSP processing power just a bit,
brought multitimbral performance down to 4-parts from 16 and polyphony
is reduced from 80 voices down to 50 voices, but left the underlying
synthesizer engine untouched. The TI Snow thus bridges the price gap,
giving users the power and flexibility of a Virus TI, in a compact and
more affordable desktop sound module.The TI Snow has the same synthesizer engine found in the rest of the TI
series. In a nutshell, this includes three oscillators with one sub
oscillator per voice,  a wide collection of waveforms including the
classic Virus virtual analog models, the massive HyperSaw, Wavetable,
Graintable, and Formant waveforms. Two multi-mode filters (HP, LP, BP,
BS) and an Analog Filter mode modeled after the Moog cascade filter with
6 to 24 dB/oct slopes. A modulation matrix with 6 sources and 3
destinations each (18 routings total). Three LFOs and two very fast
ADSTR envelope generators. A fully featured 32-step arpeggiator for
creating really nice and musical arpeggiated patterns. A complete
effects section with 129 parallel effects. And finally, the Atomizer
beat slicer-n-dicer.All parameters are controlled from three knobs located below the white
LCD display screen. They can be assigned to a parameter from the rows of
buttons on the right which also double as patch select buttons. Even
though the TI Snow has eliminated almost all on-board knobs in order to
slim it down, the Snow is still just as flexible and programmable as the
original...albeit, there will be a lot of menu diving to get to the
desired parameters. Fortunately the TI system has the VIRUSControl
plug-in software that will give you in-depth graphical access to all
parameters when connected to a computer. This is the exact same control
plug-in software used by the rest of the TI series and is really the key
to blowing any limitations of the Snow's hardware interface out of the
water.The Total Integration system allows you to plug your Virus TI Snow into
your computer via the USB port located on the back. Once it's hooked up
to your computer you can access the Virus TI from your DAW where it will
appear as a VST/AU plug-in (certified hosts: Apple Logic, Steinberg
Cubase, Ableton Live, Avid Pro Tools, Cakewalk Sonar and ImageLine FL
Studio). This brings the TI into your computer based music studio with
plug-and-play ease where you can use the TI Snow as it was clearly
intended - as a sound module. You can easily use the VIRUSControl
plug-in to quickly browse patches, make in-depth program tweaks, or use
the hardware itself for basic tweaks or if you want to play/record any
real-time control changes via the three main knobs. You can even assign
your Virus TI Snow as your computer's sound card which will route all of
your DAWs audio out the Snow's stereo outputs and you can use its stereo
inputs to bring sounds into your DAW. In other words, a laptop, a
certified DAW, the Virus TI Snow and a small keyboard controller could
be all you need for a complete music workstation!Continuously updated versions of the OS that can be downloaded and
installed into the Virus TI series ensure that this hardware synth will
always have the most sophisticated software under its hood. If you've
ever wanted to get yourself a Virus TI and can sacrifice hands-on
controls or have been out-priced by previous models so far, the Virus TI
Snow may be the the right choice for you.",

technology, but it never succeeded. The Voyetra is not at all a bad
synthesizer. It creates rather striking sounds. At first glance it looks
like an old computer system. It is composed of two pieces, the VPK-5
remote 61 note keyboard with aftertouch and velocity. And then there is
the main synthesizer module itself. The synth is analog with 8 voices of
polyphony.Up front and very hands on are some knobs for basic but essential
controls like cutoff, attack, LFO rate, de-tune and more. Much more
in-depth programming and modulation routing can be done using the
computer-like interface. There's a great 24dB/oct low pass filter, a
very flexible and routable pair of LFOs for creating really weird or
sweeping sounds and effects. There are 100 patches for storing your
settings. There is even a simple arpeggiator, a 1700 note sequencer and
a ring modulator.The Voyetra 8 is a sophisticated analog instrument. Only serious
musicians should consider it, however. Its programming can be difficult
and require a lot of skill and knowledge. It is also very pricey and
often hard to find. The Voyetra 8 has been used by New Order, Depeche
Mode, the Eurythmics, and Trevor Horn (""Video Killed The Radio
Star"").Note: The Voyetra 8 was made by the company Octave-Plateau (originally
Octave Electronics) who in 1986 changed their company name to Voyetra
and then finally to Voyetra Turtle Beach.",

The x0xb0x however, is better than so many of its competitors. Originally, and currently, sold as a DIY kit by Ladyada, the x0xb0x began life as a graduate student's quest for the perfect TB-303 sound. Ladyada reverse engineered a real TB-303, part by part, and designed a clone that sounds very nearly identical to the TB-303. The kits are extremely popular, so you can expect to wait for some time on their waiting list before one becomes available for sale. Third party companies have also sprung up that offer pre-built x0xb0x synths, the most popular of which is Mode Machines in Germany.The x0xb0x panel looks pretty much like what you'll find on a TB-303. Emulation is the sincerest form of flattery, and the x0xb0x is trying hard to flatter, but with some modernizations. The x0xb0x is a monophonic synthesizer that you can control via MIDI just like a regular monophonic synth. It also has the requisite sequencer that arranges notes into patterns, and patterns into tracks for a song. Patterns can be synced to MIDI, DINSYNC, and CV. You can also enter the tempo by using tap-tempo. Track play can also sync in a similar fashion. And the x0xb0x can also send sync information to a MIDI sequencer or even an old analog.The x0xb0x has a USB jack that be used to connect it to a computer for updating the firmware and operating system, external control, as well as using it with third party software tools.Ladyada x0xb0x (first release candidate)If you are interested in building your own x0xb0x, be prepared to build a fairly advanced electronics project. This is not a beginner's project, but if you have some soldering experience and feel safe around electricity, you can probably build one successfully. You can order the x0xb0x with or without the miniature surface-mount USB jack and chip pre-soldered (it is advisable to pay for this option). And of course, you can customize the machine to your heart's content. There are many sites on the internet that showcase various x0xb0x customizations. You can also find third party companies that sell custom panels for x0xb0x builders.",
